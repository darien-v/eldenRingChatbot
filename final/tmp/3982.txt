Status Effects can be applied on both enemies and players alike. Status Effects are triggered after a buildup meter is filled by repeated application of attacks that cause the effect. Both players and enemies can have varying resistances to a given Status Effect.\n\nElden Ring Hemorrhage Guide\nHemorrhage (also known as Blood Loss) is a status effect that builds up through repeated application of the effect. Hemorrhage is inflicted via various means including Weapons, Skills and Spells. Once the Hemorrhage meter is filled, the effect is triggered and the target takes damage equal to a percentage of their Max HP.\nHemorrhage (combined with it's governing stat, Arcane) is the only status effect and stat combo that stacks multiplicatively with itself.\n\nHemorrhage Effects in Elden Ring\nA Hemorrhage occurs when the amount of bleed damage (also called blood loss) becomes higher than the target's Robustness, causing immediate damage and consuming the effect. The damage is equal to a percentage of the target's Max HP.\n\nHemorrhage inflicts 15% of a normal enemy's max HP plus 100 or 200 damage depending on the weapon used.\nMost bosses, as well as normal enemies located in boss rooms, will take 10.5% of their max HP plus 100 or 200 damage depending on the weapon used. \n\nThe exception to this is Mohg, Lord of Blood who takes 7.5% max HP plus 100 or 200 damage.\n\nWeapons that deal % + 200 damage: Reduvia, Morgott's Cursed Sword, Varré's Bouquet, Hoslow's Petal Whip (any affinity), and then any weapon with innate Hemorrhage buildup when infused with Blood Affinity. \n\nAll other sources of Hemorrhage deal % + 100 damage.\n\nThere are no cooldowns or other limits in place to prevent Hemorrhage from being repeatedly, and/or instantly triggered.\nHemorrhage's build up can be slowed by raising your Robustness stat, increasing the amount of bleed damage required to trigger the effect. Robustness can be improved by adding points into Endurance. \n\nThe Damage Type inflicted by Hemorrhage's activation is unknown, and doesn't seem to be reduced by any type of Defensive Stat.\n\nHemorrhage buildup can be eliminated by consuming Stanching Boluses, or by the Incantations of Bestial Constitution and Lord's Aid. \n\nCompared to other Status Effects, Hemorrhage has several unique mechanics which drastically reduce the viability of the above options in most situations, especially during Player-versus-Player.\n\nElden Ring Hemorrhage Effect on Players\nThis

A lot of different equipment pieces or Ashes of War that can be equipped to increase the chances of bleed. There are a few existing Bleed builds that have been made to strengthen these effects as a Melee player or Magic player. A few are perfect for beginners who want to strengthen bleed. There are 4 Ashes of War to consider that have a direct Affinity with Bleed. With these in mind, players can experiment creating their own Bleed Builds or test and modify a few existing Ones.   \n\nAsh of War: Blood Blade\nAsh of War: Bloody Slash\nAsh of War: Blood Tax\nAsh of War: Seppuku\n\nBloodblade Build\nOne example is the Bloodblade Build for Beginners: A Bleed-focused Build that uses the Bleed Status Effect to continuously rip off huge chunks of enemy health via dual blades. To view other Builds, check out the Builds page for more late game or endgame builds that uses Bleed.\n\nClass: Warrior\nFlask Spread: All HP\nWeapon: Scimitar x2\nShield: Any that can Parry\nArmor: Heaviest you can wear and still Med Roll\nPrimary Stats: Vigor & Endurance\nSecondary Stats: Dexterity & Arcane\nSkills: Ash of War: Bloody Slash x2\nSpells: None\n\nThe way this Build works is that you slot the Ash of War: Bloody Slash on to both Scimitars so that when you strike with both weapons via L1 you build up Bleed faster. To do this you will need a Lost Ashes of War and you'll need to Duplicate it at Blacksmith Hewg. Focus on using running and jumping L1 attacks as these do 4 hits very quickly, as opposed to just L1 by itself which does 2 or rolling L1 which does 3.  Keep in mind enemy Bleed bars are not visible, but they drain just like players, meaning you must strike repeatedly and often or you won't rip off chunks of HP via Bleed. Enemies also seem to have increased resistance with each subsequent Bleed, so it will take more and more strikes the more you set this Status. Play aggressively, but make sure not to get yourself killed going for the Bleed proc. Wear the heaviest Armor you can and still mid roll, so that if you do get hit, it deals the least amount of damage possible. Use Bloody Slash when necessary, but it's situational. It's long cast time makes it hard to use, even if it's damage is incredibly high. \nFAQ: Is Bleed still Op Elden Ring?\n\nThe bleed effect has received a reputation in Elden Ring of being OP, with Weapons such as Rivers of Blood and Moonveil receiving plenty of attention from players vocalizing varying degrees of praise as well as criticism from different users, especially when faced against in PvP modes and invasions. Since the initial release of the game, developers have since released a number of Patches and Updates in attempts to add more balance to the game including a nerf to Rivers of Blood during the 1.06 Patch in August 2022. As of the end of 2022, players continue to call for nerfs to the stats of different Bleed Weapons such as Moonveil.\n\nHemorrhage Other Notes \n\nHemorrhage has been largely changed from DS1 and DS2, and between Arcane and Hemorrhage, has elevated the Status Effect as a source of direct damage rivaling that of pure damage scaling  - rather than functioning as a heavy debuff to Stamina, Stamina Regen, Max HP, and movement speed, it now only functions as a direct damage source. Several design changes have also altered previously existing mechanics, fundamentally changing counterplay options. This is in contrast to other status effects receiving similar changes while generally retaining the counterplay options of previous games. \n\nPreviously Hemorrhage rewarded consistently landing blows in quick succession to cripple the enemy, providing a large advantage and opportunity to end the fight. Bleed buildup was much more conservative, and it drained much more quickly in previous games, often requiring several actions to trigger it.\nElden Ring has more bleed buildup sources, many of which can be stacked to achieve multiplicative scaling - allowing bleed buildup to be stacked higher than in previous games. Additionally, because there is no cooldown preventing Hemorrhage from being repeatedly applied, it incentivizes getting as much blood loss build-up as possible in a short amount of time. \n\nAs blood-loss buildup is increased, the number of attacks required to inflict Hemorrhage can be continually reduced to the point where a single attack can trigger Hemorrhage. When compounded by true combos, multi-hit or power-stanced attacks, Hemorrhage can be activated multiple times with a single action. This can be further compounded with various Skills, Spells, and Consumables, all of which will inflict their full effect simultaneously.\nHemorrhage's potential damage scales well into late-game, primarily due to not having a cooldown - as bleed damage rises, actions / hits required to inflict Hemorrhage are reduced - and the sooner a Hemorrhage is triggered, the sooner any and all subsequent procs can be applied.\nAdditionally, defense and resistance have been simplified to a single value: Robustness, which can be increased by leveling up endurance or wearing armor. \n\nDS2 included defensive values for shields against status build in addition to direct damage\nCurrently all robustness from endurance and armor increase the amount of buildup your character can endure before the active effect is triggered. \n\nSince bleed buildup has several ways to multiplicatively stack, high Robustness can be countered by having hemorrhage proc instantly through true combos or offensive spells in addition to melee attacks. This style of play also limits the effectiveness of Staunching Boluses or incantations like Bestial Constitution since hemorrhage cannot be retroactively mitigated, but lends itself to predictable patterns of aggression. \nPrevious games included different methods to temporarily increase resistance to status buildup.  \n\nThe one remaining application of this design is the Incantation Immutable Shield, which enchants a shield to prevent all status build up from a blocked attack.\n\nMany attacks and spells which inflict bleed buildup currently are bugged, and can trigger Hemorrhage even when the attack itself misses due to active dodges, parries, or hitbox interaction.\nInterviews with Miyazaki indicated they had originally planned to develop each of the currently existing status types as their own category of magic on the level of Sorceries and Incantations, but they nixed that idea because it was a bit too restrictive on builds.[citation needed] It appears they were instead grouped into Arcane. \n\nStatus Effects in Elden Ring\n\nDeath Blight  ♦  Frostbite  ♦  Madness  ♦  Poison  ♦  Scarlet Rot  ♦  Sleep\n\n

QUESTION
What unique mechanics does Hemorrhage have compared to other Status Effects in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Hemorrhage has unique mechanics in Elden Ring such as it stacks multiplicatively with itself, can be triggered instantly with no cooldown, and cannot be retroactively mitigated by items like Staunching Boluses.
