The Ordovis's Greatsword scales primarily with Strength, Dexterity and Faith. It is a good Weapon for Faith builds. \n\nGreatsword of Ordovis, one of the two honored as foremostamong the Crucible Knights.\nThis sword is imbued with an ancient holy essence.Its red tint exemplifies the nature of primordial gold, said to beclose in nature to life itself.\n\nWhere to Find Ordovis's Greatsword in Elden Ring\nThe Ordovis's Greatsword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nDropped by Crucible Knight Ordovis, located at Auriza Hero's Grave.

Since both Dex and Faith Scaling on this weapon are terrible, rushing to 80 STR is the best option to maximise damage on both regular attacks and the skill.\nThe Vortex is slow, meaning you'll need either proper timing or high poise to pull off a full charge. It has an AOE so can take out multiple enemies, and when you slam it into the ground it has a ripple effect depending on how much Vortex was charged. These ripples each due rapid damage that quickly stacks up, and they cause enemies to stagger on each one. If you're quick with a heavy follow up, you can cause a stance break.\nSell Value:   1000\nVortex deals both Physical and Holy Damage, though much more Physical than Holy (~80%).\nAs a chargeable weapon skill, the Godfrey Icon and Shard of Alexander will both increase the damage of the Vortex.\nVortex grants a good amount of Poise, making it hard to interrupt\nLike most weapons that deal multiple damage types, this weapon has increased AR to compensate for the fact that its damage is calculated against two different enemy resistances (standard or pierce, and holy in this case).\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below. Additionally, speed, range, recovery time and guard counter speed of Greatswords weapons has increased. \n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Ordovis's Greatsword\n\nGreatswords Showcase\n\nCrucible Knight Written Guide\n\nOrdovis's Greatsword PVP Poise Damage Values in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations.
