Beware of the Erdtree Burial Watchdogs ready and watching for trespassers to jump on. Players should also walk carefully when moving up stairways so as not to stumble into a face full of icy breath being shot down the corridors by the frost traps. To access the boss room of this area you must hit the lever found far inside the catacombs. Gain access to the second floor near the tall frost trap and hit it so it goes down, then get on top and hit it again to rise up to the third floor and activate the lever.\nWalkthrough Instructions\nHeading up the stairs from the Site of Grace the first room is more stairs, with a 90 degree right  turn and a large pit on the side, players will die if they fall into the pit. \n\nThere is 1 imp at the turn of the stairs that can be a surprise, make sure not to fall off during this fight.\n\nThe corridor at the top of the stairs has a frost trap at the end of it breathing icy-breath that will do damage and apply Frostbite if it connects.\n\nTime your step and move between the safe pockets on the sides of the corridor. Once at the frost trap hit it once to have it lower into the ground and stop firing the breath. On the way down the corridor there is one safe pocket on the right side and then another one further on to the left side.\nAs you hop into the left "pocket", you'll find imp waiting to jump and attack the player, get behind the imp to stay away from the icy breath while fighting. Going down this path will lead to the locked boss doors of the catacombs and further into the catacombs, but we have to first unlock the boss door.\n\nThe room with this first frost trap is a dead end room, jump onto the frost trap to be raised up to the ledge above where an imp is waiting to attack. A corpse sat in front of the tomb at the top holds a Rejuvenating Boluses.\n\nHaving retrieved the only "loot" form this room, head back out, and proceed back to where the locked boss doors were. When you get to where the boss doors are, turn right, but walk carefully when going up the next set of stairs as there will be another frost trap breathing down the doorway at the top.\n\nThis room is a large hall with a tall ceiling and a tall frost trap.  There are 3 floors that can be seen in this room with the lever for the locked door found on the third floor. On the right close to the entrance is an imp, as well as an Erdtree Burial Watchdog with a staff on the 2nd floor that will jump down to attack you. There is also an Imp on the left side of the second floor. It's recommended to lure him out if you have a ranged attack, so that he won't be able to ambush you when you get to the second floor.\n\nA body with 4 Root Resin can also be found in this room.\nHitting the frost trap will lower it but instead of turning off the breath, the now lowered statue will breathe the icy breath in the other directions, down the tunnels leading out of the room. The icy breathe can be used to help deal with the Watchdogs as you can make them follow you into the tunnels then use a ranged attack to lower the frost trap, round the corner to have the watchdog stop chasing and keep taking damage from the frost trap.\nThe passageway on the left leads to a dead end room with 4 imps in it with a Grave Glovewort (9) inside, a Grave Glovewort (8) is found in the tunnel between.\nThe passageway on the right leads to a larger room with stairs. This room has 2 imps in it, one found close on the right of the entrance and one up the stairs.\n\nGoing up the stairs will bring you to a dead end room with an Erdtree Burial Watchdog with a sword sitting over a body that has the Imp Head (Elder) as well as a Grave Glovewort (9), a Grave Violet, and 8 Human Bone Shard.\nInstead of going up the stairs, there is a pathway under the stairs leading to the next room of the catacombs. A Lesser Cleanrot Knight is found inside, patrolling the room, as well as a Grave Glovewort (8). (The good news is that the understair corridor is too narrow for the Erdtree Burial Watchdog to follow you through, so you can avoid fighting it.)\n\nAs you enter the room, on the left there'll be a set of stairs, walk up them, but carefully; if the tall frost trap is raised up it will wait for the player to peek out before spraying the ice breath, at the top of the stairs is an imp that is waiting to attack unless you lured him out earlier. These stairs lead to the second floor in the large hall (that you saw the Erdtree Burial Watchdog standing on earlier), and on the left side is a Grave Glovewort (9) as well as a room with 2 Lesser Cleanrot Knights within and the Ghost Glovewort (9).\n\nWith the second floor done, we're ready to go up to the 3rd floor and finally open the boss lever.\nHit the frost trap to lower it if it isn't already lowered then, exit the room with the 2 Lesser Cleanrot Knights, and safely jump on top of the frost trap, then hit it to raise it up to the third floor of the room to find the lever.\n\nA Grave Glovewort (9) and a Golden Rune (12) can be found here on this third floor on either side of the lever.\n\nWith the boss door open, simply exit this large room in the way that you came to get to the boss door.\nBOSS BATTLE: PUTRID GRAVE WARDEN DUELIST\nThe fight with this boss is without any additional enemies. This boss wields a large axe with two hands, running at their target and spinning their axe. Many of their attacks are slow spinning attacks that players can roll away from to easily get out of range. The boss will occasionally throw their axe at players.\nUsing Spirit Ashes can make this boss easy to deal with as the additional attacks from the ashes can interrupt the boss' slow attacks making the fight much safer and easier.\n\nElden Ring Consecrated Snowfield Catacombs Gallery and Notes\n\nAll Elden Ring Locations\n\nAbandoned Cave  ♦  Academy Crystal Cave  ♦  Academy Gate Town  ♦  Aeonia Swamp  ♦  Ailing Village  ♦  Ainsel River  ♦  Ainsel River Main  ♦  Ainsel River Well  ♦  Albinauric Rise  ♦  Altus Plateau  ♦  Altus Tunnel  ♦  Apostate Derelict  ♦  Artist's Shack  ♦  Auriza Hero's Grave  ♦  Auriza Side Tomb  ♦  Bellum Church  ♦  Bellum Highway  ♦  Bestial Sanctum  ♦  Black Knife Catacombs  ♦  Boilprawn Shack  ♦  Bridge of Sacrifice  ♦  Caelem Ruins  ♦  Caelid  ♦  Caelid Catacombs  ♦  Caelid Colosseum  ♦  Caelid Waypoint Ruins  ♦  Callu Baptismal Church  ♦  Capital Outskirts  ♦  Caria Manor  ♦  Carian Study Hall  ♦  Carriage  ♦  Castle Morne  ♦  Castle Sol  ♦  Cathedral of Manus Celes  ♦  Cathedral of the Forsaken  ♦  Cave of the Forlorn  ♦  Chapel of Anticipation  ♦  Chelona's Rise  ♦  Church of Dragon Communion  ♦  Church of Elleh  ♦  Church of Inhibition  ♦  Church of Irith  ♦  Church of Pilgrimage  ♦  Church of Repose  ♦  Church of the Plague  ♦  Church of Vows  ♦  Cliffbottom Catacombs  ♦  Colosseums  ♦  Converted Fringe Tower  ♦  Converted Tower  ♦  Corpse-Stench Shack  ♦  Craftsman's Shack  ♦  Cuckoo's Evergaol  ♦  Deathtouched Catacombs  ♦  Deep Ainsel Well  ♦  Deep Siofra Well  ♦  Deeprooth Depths  ♦  Demi-Human Forest Ruins  ♦  Divine Tower of Caelid  ♦  Divine Tower of East Altus  ♦  Divine Tower of Limgrave  ♦  Divine Tower of Liurnia  ♦  Divine Tower of West Altus  ♦  Dragon-Burnt Ruins  ♦  Dragonbarrow  ♦  Dragonbarrow Cave  ♦  East Windmill Pasture  ♦  Effigies of the Martyr  ♦  Elden Throne  ♦  Eternal City  ♦  First Church of Marika  ♦  Flame Peak  ♦  Forbidden Lands  ♦  Forest Lookout Tower  ♦  Forge of the Giants  ♦  Forlorn Hound Evergaol  ♦  Forsaken Ruins  ♦  Fort Faroth  ♦  Fort Gael  ♦  Fort Haight  ♦  Fort Laiedd  ♦  Fourth Church of Marika  ♦  Frenzied Flame Proscription  ♦  Frenzied Flame Village  ♦  Frenzy-Flaming Tower  ♦  Fringefolk Hero's Grave  ♦  Gael Tunnel  ♦  Gaol Cave  ♦  Gatefront Ruins  ♦  Gelmir Hero's Grave  ♦  Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave  ♦  Golden Lineage Evergaol  ♦  Gowry's Shack  ♦  Grand Cloister  ♦  Grand Lift of Dectus  ♦  Grand Lift of Rold  ♦  Groveside Cave  ♦  Guardians' Garrison  ♦  Hallowhorn Grounds  ♦  Heretical Rise  ♦  Hermit's Shack  ♦  Hermit Merchant's Shack  ♦  Hermit Village  ♦  Hidden Path to the Haligtree  ♦  Highroad Cave  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Liurnia)  ♦  Impaler's Catacombs  ♦  Isolated Divine Tower  ♦  Isolated Merchant's Shack (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Jarburg  ♦  Kingsrealm Ruins  ♦  Lake of Rot  ♦  Lakeside Crystal Cave  ♦  Laskyar Ruins  ♦  Lenne's Rise  ♦  Leyndell Catacombs  ♦  Leyndell Colosseum  ♦  Leyndell Royal Capital  ♦  Limgrave  ♦  Limgrave Colosseum  ♦  Limgrave Tunnels  ♦  Lord Contender's Evergaol  ♦  Lunar Estate Ruins  ♦  Lux Ruins  ♦  Malefactor's Evergaol  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Caelid)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Consecrated Snowfield)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Northeast)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Southwest)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mistwood)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mountaintops East)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mt.
