CONTEXT
\nCharacter Creation for Elden Ring allows players to fully shape and customize their character. When creating a character, you are able to define a wide variety of features, ranging from its voice and face structure, to gamestyle-defining characteristics like its Class.\nElden Ring features a Rebirth mechanic that allows you to Respec your character. You can unlock this function by defeating Rennala Queen of the Full Moon. Once defeated, you'll be able to trade Larval Tears for a Respec. Please visit the Rebirth Page for more information on how to respec your character.\nCharacter Creation in Elden Ring\nIn Elden Ring, you have the option to choose your character's Name, Body Type (Male/Female), Age, Class, Keepsake and tweak its physical appearance. Additionally, you have the option to choose among 10 character presets under "Base Templates". In this page you'll find a comprehensive description of what these attributes do and how they work.\n\nWhat is the Best Class in Elden Ring?\nRegardless of the type of character you choose, any Class allows you to complete your journey through The Lands Between. You should pick your character class based on the playstyle that best suits you, as combat styles greatly vary since the early stages of the game and these differences intensify throughout the game. That said, some classes provide an easier start. The recommended classes for beginners are Vagabond due to the straightforward starting gear and good stats for a melee focused playstyle, and Samurai as it starts with a Longbow and a good amount of arrows, and an Uchigatana which is a very good bleed weapon. For those looking for a magic casting class, the Astrologer is a strong beginner option with its focus in sorcery type magic.\nCan I respec my Character in Elden Ring?\nYes, you will be able to reallocate your character's stat points once you have the ability to do so. In addition to learning the skill, you will be required to turn in a rare item in exchange for reallocating points. You will be able to get the ability to respec your character during your playthrough. Please visit the Rebirth Page for more information on how to respec your character.\n\nWho do we play as in Elden Ring?\nIn Elden Ring, the players explore as a chracter is known as a Tarnished, part of a tribe that once lived in the Lands Between until they were expelled from the kingdom. The characters can be modeled to many different appearances during character creation and can be sorted into different Classes. The Tarnished are known as a group of outcasts who were once exiled. They return and rise to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between, which is where the gameplay main storyline begins. According to legend, they have been promised the Elden Lordship.\nThe Tarnished\nIn the opening of the official reveal trailer that was presented in E3 2021, we see a softly spoken, hooded woman saying "The Tarnished, will soon return." The question is, who and what is The Tarnished? Simply put, you are the Tarnished. As the player, you are one of the Tarnished that have been exiled upon losing their blessing of Grace granted by the Elden Ring and the Erdtree, a tree that hosts source and life of The Lands Between. Very much like previous Souls games, where you are the Chosen Undead or the Ashen One. After the shattering of the Elden Ring, you are then called back by this lost Grace to The Lands Between, along with other Tarnished to recover the shards of the Elden Ring, to make them whole once again, and to become the Elden Lord of The Lands Between.\n\nCreate Character Screen\n\nBase Attributes\nThe first basic attribute to define in the main Character Creation window is Name, followed by the "Body Type" option, in which the sex of your character is chosen. This is done by selecting between two options: "Type A" (Male) and "Type B" (Female).\nNext you can select you character's apparent Age: Young, Mature or Aged. Here the game explains that this option "only affects appearance" and "has no bearing on ability".\nAt the main Character Creation window, you are also able to preview both the initial Stats for your character, as well as the appearance of the character itself. You can zoom in or out and rotate your character's model for further examination.\n\nElden Ring Character Appearance\nBesides Body Type and Age, there are two other sections to further shape the character's appearance: "Choose Base Template" and "Detailed Appearance". The first one provides 10 different appearance presets to choose from. Even though each is displayed with a brief description, this is not a background for the character, but more of a description of represented type of character.\nThe second section accesses the "Detailed Appearance" sub-menu. Here, a wide variety of appearance-defining controls are available for players to tweak the aspect of their character. It also offers options to save and recall custom presets.\n\nChoose Base Template\n"Choose Base Template" offers 10 different pre-set character appearances to set the starting point of your aesthetics customization process. These provide a wide range of varying traits such as hairstyle, skin color and body shape. Each template is displayed with a description of the intended type of descendance. However, note that this is not a background for the character itself, it doesn't reflect any narrative arc and won't affect gameplay.\n§Available templates\n\nWarrior\n\nThe most common face among the Tarnished. After all, they were all warriors once.\n\nTruth-Seeker\n\nThe face of an austere pilgrim. There are many roads to truth.\n\nAristocrat\n\nA regal face found among those who claim noble blood in the Lands Between.\n\nLoner\n\nFace found among a proud and seclusive tribe of folk well-versed in ancient legends and heresies alike.\n\nNortherner\n\nA face found among the hardy people of the unforgiving north.

Few in number, they were said to bleed silver long ago.\n\nNumen\n\nThe face of the Numen, supposed descendants of denizens of another world. Long-lived but seldom born.\n\nDetailed Appearance\nThis section offers a variety of controls to tweak the aspect of the character. These options are divided in 5 groups: Age, Voice, Alter Skin Color, Alter Face & Hair and Alter Body.\nIt also offers options to save custom presets by selecting "Save to Favorites" and recall them using "Load Favorite".\n\nAlter Skin Color\nThis tab allows you to modify the skin color of your character, either from a "Preset Colors" palette or by fine-tuning it with the "Adjust Color" option, which gives an even deeper control on skin tone.\nThe color of the skin is applied on top of the selected Base Template, and "Temporary Colors" can be stored.\ndetails on the adjust color menu and functionality.\n\nAlter Face & Hair\n In the "Alter Face & Hair" menu, you will come across 11 more options to further manipulate specific parts of the character's face and hair. These are:\n\nAdjust Face Template: Select among a variety of pre-set faces.\nFace Structure: Modify the shape of the face with dedicated controls.\nHair: Modify the character's hairstyle.

Option appears after meeting the Three Fingers.\n\nElden Ring Keepsakes\n\nKeepsakes in Elden Ring are optional pieces of equipment available to the player at Character Creation, granting additional strength at the start of one's journey. There are nine Keepsakes to choose from, but players may opt to start the game without one. This page covers their names, descriptions, usages, and recommendations for which to take.\nAll Keepsakes are obtainable later in the game, some near immediately, meaning that you can safely make your choice for the early-game.\n\nElden Ring Keepsakes\n\nName\nDescription\nUsage\n\n  None \nNo keepsake.

Below are reasons for taking some of the more popular among them:\n\n  Lands Between Rune - An instant  3000 Runes. Allows for early level-ups or Merchant purchases. \n  Golden Seed - Grants an additional charge for your Sacred Flasks, providing extra HP or FP restoration. \n  Fanged Imp Ashes - A duo of Fanged Imps that can deal significant damage to high health targets using attacks which inflict Blood Loss. \n  Stonesword Key - Gain early access to areas gated by imp statues. These keys are readily purchasable, but at a starting price of  2000 Runes. \n\nNot Recommended Keepsakes in Elden Ring\nWhile Keepsakes will not have a significant impact on your overall experience, below are reasons why some fall short of a recommendation:\n\n  Crimson Amber Medallion - Relatively minor health increase. Readily purchasable for  1500 Runes. \n  Cracked Pot - Used to craft throwing pots, but requires Cookbooks for greater variety and collecting Materials for consistent use. Three are readily purchasable for  300 Runes each. \n  Bewitching Branch - Inconsistent against different types of enemies, and limited quantity. \n  Boiled Prawn - Fair damage negation and duration, but their limited quantity can make players hesitant to use them at the right time, if at all. \n  Shabriri's Woe - Generating enmity can be situationally powerful. However, its strengths are better explored when players are more familiar with the available summons and Spirit Ashes. \n\nChoosing a Class in Elden Ring\nWhen you begin the game, you'll be able to choose from one of 10 classes. The choice you make affects the equipment with which you begin your adventure. \nEach class has its own starting equipment and items.\n\nClasses for Elden Ring are the combat archetypes available at Character Creation. Choosing a class determines the player's base Stats and the Equipment they start with. This page covers each class, their attribute point allocation, and equipment. In addition, this page also covers classes which were only available during the Network Test.\n\nElden Ring Classes Overview\n\nWho should I start with in Elden ring?\nWell-rounded Classes are recommended for players starting out with Elden Ring. Beginners will have to decide what playstyle they have, how they want to approach the game, and then how they want to Build their character later on. Each Class also comes with a set of starting equipment that can later be acquired through regular gameplay, so the most important things to consider are each Classes' Stats and strengths. Consider which kinds of Weapons or Equipment you prefer and then create a build that best suits when you prefer Melee, Ranged or Magic Combat. Players have created their own recommended Builds suitable for beginners or players with an Attribute in mind.
