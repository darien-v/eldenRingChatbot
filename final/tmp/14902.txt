CONTEXT
\n\n Knight Diallos \n\nLocation\nRoundtable Hold\n\nRole\nQuest NPC\n\nVoiced by\nPeter Caulfield\n\nDiallos is an NPC in Elden Ring. Diallos is a noble you'll come across at the Roundtable Hold. Upon welcoming you, he mentions that he's looking for a loyal servant to his house called Lanya, and asks you to tell him if you happen to come across her.\n\n The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood.\nI, Diallos, swear to deliver that promise.\n\nDiallos Location in Elden Ring\nDiallos can be found at Roundtable Hold.\n\nThis NPC changes location, and can later be found at North Liurnia of The Lakes [Map Link]\nAfter that, he can be found at Volcano Manor\nAfter that, he can be found at Jarburg\nIf defeated, drops: Hoslow's Petal Whip, Diallos's Mask.\n\nDiallos Questline: How to complete Diallos' Quest\n\nAfter talking with Diallos at the Roundtable Hold, you'll find him to the North and slightly West of the Academy Gate Town Site of Grace in Northern Liurnia [Map link] atop a sunken roof. \n\nDiallos is standing at ground level west of the grace on the northern edge of the town ruins. If you look on the map, he's located at almost exactly the rightmost tip of the Academy Gate Town icon.\nNOTE: If you complete the Volcano Manor legacy dungeon before speaking to Diallos here, he will not appear and you cannot complete the quest - making this progression a potential point of failure.\n\nHe will then be at the Roundtable Hold again. Exhaust his dialogue, where he talks about having discovered where the recusants are coming from.\nHe'll be at Volcano Manor, in the drawing room, having decided to join the organization. Diallos gets new dialogue for every step of the Volcano Manor assassination sidequests the player completes. His last line of dialogue before he relocates has him lament over how easily he was swayed to join the recusants.\nAfter accepting the second letter from Volcano Manor OR after defeating Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy he will leave the manor and relocate to Jarburg. \n\nIf he does not appear in Jarburg after receiving 2 letters from Volcano Manor, return to Volcano Manor and exhaust all his dialogues. Reload the area and exhaust the dialogs again (when approaching him, he should say something like "my brother was right", if this does not happen, you need to reload the area again and exhaust his dialogs). After that, he should move to Jarburg.\nIt is possible to skip doing any of the assassination missions and still have Diallos appear in Jarburg. Exhaust what dialogue you can with him, defeat Rykard, visit Volcano Manor to see he is no longer there, and then go to Jarburg to find him.\n\nAfter progressing Jar-Bairn's questline he will appear in one of the shacks, tending to a little jar. \n\nRepeatedly talk to Jar-Bairn and rest at the Site of Grace in Jarburg until Jar-Bairn talks about poachers. If you've gotten this questline to advance, Jar-Bairn will talk about a new Potentate who's just arrived.\n\nAfter seeing him in Jarburg, let some time pass. Once enough time has passed, and you can talk to Diallos once more. After exhausting dialogue with him and Jar-Bairn you can rest to advance the quest.\nAfter exhausting Alexander's dialogue in Radahn's Arena after Radahn's defeat and thus progressing that questline, return to Jarburg. It will have been attacked and Diallos is wounded. Exhaust his and Jar-Bairn's dialogue and he'll ask if he was able to defend the jars, to which you can tell him he succeeded or he failed. He will die shortly after either way. Upon reloading the area, Jar-Bairn will move over to Diallos, scavenging his remains and taking up Diallos's legacy.Upon another reloading of the area, Jar-Bairn will move to the first location. \n\nIf you have defeated Radahn and have already talked to Alexander in his location, but Jarburg has not been attacked, you should go to the Starcourge Radahn Site of Grace, and then back to Jarburg.\nIt is possible that one night cycle may be required to progress this quest. Try resting at the site of grace in Jarburg and "Pass Time until nightfall" to force the poacher attack to occur.\n\nExhaust Jar-Bairn's dialogue and reload the area and, Diallos’s body will disappear, leaving behind Diallos's Mask, Hoslow's Petal Whip, and Numen's Rune.\nComplete the remainder of Alexander's questline, then return here to give Jar Bairn Alexander's Innards. Reload the area again to Receive the Companion Jar Talisman from where Jar-Bairn was previously seated.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Diallos\n§Introduction\n\nAh, hello. \n\nYou must be new here. \n\nI'm..\n\nWell, just call me Diallos.\n\nThe honor of one's house holds little import in these lands.\n\nBy the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels?\n\nShe's my servant, but fickle as the wind.\n\nTake your eyes off her for but a moment \n\nand she's good as gone.\n\nIf you find her, please be sure to tell me.\n\nBe sure to tell me \n\nif you meet a young woman named Lanya.\n\nShe's a servant to my house. \n\nShe's been my companion since childhood.\n\nI've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this.\n\nHonestly, she's such a little tomboy.\n\nAt Academy Gate Town\n\nLanya... Lanya... It's me Diallos. Answer me, would you?\nHello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you.The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished.They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand."The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.\nThey laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand."The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.\n\nAt the Roundtable Hold\n\nAh, you again is it? The recusants sent a lackey.Can you believe they invited me to join them? Now! After what they did...I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool?You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer.Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout.It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills.That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.Just you wait, wretched recusants.You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya."The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.\n\nAt Volcano Manor\n\nAh. Oh... I-it's you is it? Well. Nice to see you again.So you've been invited as well, I see.Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth. You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes?\nI, um... I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya... Well, you see, I...After much internal debate. I've come to realise... Revenge is not the answerAccording to Lady Tanith... I've got the stuff of champions.And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced walk a tainted a path.It hit me like a bolt from the blue... That my former thoughts were simple naiveté.Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya. That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't make me a champion, will it.Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.But such is true of any road trod by champions.\nI always resented these hands.Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.But that won't be the case for long.They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions."The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.\n\nAfter doing the Volcano Manor questline\n\nIt's just as my noble brother says. I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become a champion.\nAh, it's you is it. I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself.I haven't achieved anything at all thus far. Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again.I'm still yet to achieve anything. Perhaps I am a fool after all...No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.What an easy mark I must have been... How did it take me so long to realise, honestly.There's just no end to my foolishness, is there...\n\nJarburg\n\n(Overheard talking to NPC jar) Well. Aren't you full of beans. No wonder you're covered in muck.\nOh? My friend, it's been far too long. I have to say you caught me at a rather low point. But... as you can see, I've put all that behind me. Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now. Making my own choices. Even a fool like me can look after some simply jars. Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow.\n\n§After Jarburg is attacked\n\n...Ah, you... Are the jars... they alright? Did I defend them?\n("You defended them") Then all is well... This fool proved his worth, in the end...\n(“I'm afraid not") Ha ha...ha... I see... I see... I've been a fool... to the last...\n\nWhen attacked at Academy Gate Town\n\n(Warning)Agh! What on earth was that for?\n(Combat) Now I see. You're a wretched recusant! May you rue the day that you thought to trample me! The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! In blood!\n(On player kill) Lanya, your honour has been restored. You can rest easy.\n\nWhen attacked at Jarburg\n\n(Warning) Ugh! What's the matter? Please, stop! I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor. I will never brandish a sword again, I swear!\n(Combat) Why on earth...? Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you? I'll turn my back on duty no more. The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood! In blood!\n(On player kill) Unharmed, thank the stars.\n\nWhen defeated\n\n(At Academy Gate Town) Ha ha...ha... I am the shame of House Hoslow after all...\n(In Jarburg) Ahhh, just what I deserve... For absconding from my duties... I'm sorry, my dear jars...\n\nElden Ring Diallos Notes & Trivia\n\nIf provoked, Diallos wields a Hoslow's Petal Whip and a Distinguished Greatshield\nDiallos’s brother is Juno Hoslow, as indicated by their masks and armor set.

QUESTION
What steps need to be taken to advance Diallos' questline in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
To advance Diallos' questline in Elden Ring, one must first talk to him at the Roundtable Hold, then find him to the North and slightly West of the Academy Gate Town. Follow his progression to different locations, ensuring completion of specific actions at each, such as obtaining letters from Volcano Manor or defeating Rykard. Eventually, after progressing through various dialogues and events, including assisting Jar-Bairn, you will need to visit Diallos after Radahn's defeat, leading to his relocation and tragic fate. Rest at specific locations and exhaust dialogues to trigger the quest's progression.
