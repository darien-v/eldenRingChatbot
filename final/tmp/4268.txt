Let's get smithing.\n\n[About the chains on your legs]\n\n"I see you've noticed the chains. Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains.I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. That's all there is to it".\n\n[You're a prisoner?]\n\n"Nah, don't read too much into it. I've no grudge against you.My being a prisoner is no fault of yours. Besides, I don't mind smithing.Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same.Given time, technique never fails. Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her..."\n\n§Prayer\n\n"Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness. The road is yet long. A God is not easily felled. But one day, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika..."\n\nWhile caught praying\n\n"Ah, You, is it? I...didn't notice you there.I'll be doing my job, same as ever. Just lay out your arms".\n\n[About the prayer]\n\n"Those words were not meant for you. I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot.But my prayers are mine and mine alone. Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too."\n\n§When asked about Roderika\n\n"The girl you brought here... She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade, but she has a gift for spirit tuning.I saw another one like her, long ago. Their eyes share the same hue".\n\nAfter speaking to Roderika\n\n"The girl? What about her?"\n\n[Would you watch over Roderika?]  \n\n"Are you out of your mind?Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it".\n\n[It's what she wants]\n\n"I refuse to believe it. I don't doubt you,but I know when something's too good to be true".\n\nAfter speaking to Roderika again\n\nI spoke with the girl. She has a gift for spirit tuning. So I told her everything I know. I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago. It was all I could do to honour her.I'm sorry I doubted you.\n\nOther\n\nAfter defeating Godrick, The Grafted \n\n"Now, look at you. Those eyes tell a story. Of a challenger, who's felled her mark.Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms".\n\nInteraction while smithing\n\n"Well, where've you been hiding? I took you for dead.No matter. It's all the same. Lay out your arms, then".\n\nAfter defeating Godskin Duo \n\n"I'll smith... as long as you like" "Now ...lay out your ...arms"\n\nAfter arriving in Leyndell\n\n"No, no, no, no...I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god.I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god!Oh, it's you.Don't pay me any mind. It's not important.Just lay out your arms."\n\nAbout Roderika (after her dialogue about becoming a certified spirit tuner)\n\nThe girl has come a long way.As ever, time and technique have made her stronger. Tis good to see.An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter.But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me.I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.\n\nAfter refusing Melina's request at the Forge of the Giants\n\nAre you having second thoughts? Might I have a word, then?Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.The demigods. And their god.If you remain loyal to your calling, then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,I will never cease to smith your weapons. Until you have one to slay a god.\n\nAfter the cutscene at the Forge of the Giants\n\nI knew you'd be back. Lay out your arms. Let's get to smithing.\nWeren't you listening? As I've always said. You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.\n\nAfter speaking to Roderika again\n\nI've upset the girl. She says that now my chains are broken, I'm free. That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.What use have I for freedom now? I smith weapons to slay a god. I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.Is there any other way?\n\n§About the god-slaying weapon\n\nUse my masterpiece to slay a god. That is all that I have lived for.And my promise to Q-queen Marika. But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.\nI can't hold on much longer. I'm going the way of the R-roundtable... It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends. My lord, f-for that is what you are.\n\n§After completing Crumbling Farum Azula\n\nWho are you? Oh, I must be a blacksmith. Now, let's get smithing...\nCould you tell me what happened? Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?Why does that girl weep for me? Have I forgotten something of dire importance?\n\nElden Ring Smithing Master Hewg Notes & Trivia\n\nHe is a Misbegotten, and he shares many similarities with them. He uses the same model as the Scaly Misbegotten, although his head is altered.This currently makes him the only Misbegotten capable of speaking to the player, not unlike Iji, the only Troll that can speak.\nIf he is somehow killed in any way, he will drop the same items as the axe-wielding Misbegotten.\nHis hammer can be found in the real world, inside the Fortified Manor in Leyndell. \n\nSmithing Master Hewg Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
