For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 337 / 435 / 725 / 1182\nScarlet Rot: 337 / 435 / 725 / 1182\nHemorrhage: 337 / 435 / 725 / 1182\nFrostbite: 337 / 435 / 725 / 1182\n\nSleep: 552 / 842 / 1299\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

After Morgott hops away from the player. On big recovery attacks such as the Hammer Swings, Hammer Slams if you roll behind him, The Bloodflame infused attacks in Phase 2 (All can be punished with a light attack or a charged safely depending on the weapon's speed). On Combo Finishers such as the Helicopter. Additionally Morgott also has very low poise so you can abuse the fact by casting Ash Of War: Glintblade Phalanx twice to keep staggering him and getting free damage with critical hits.An Alternative playstyle would be maintaining distance and baiting out big attacks such as the Spear Throw which can be followed up by a huge leap with Morgott stabbing the ground with his sword and a holy spear, this attack allows for 2 charged attacks safely. Parrying is also a good option against Morgott that can synergize very nicely with dagger talisman for critical attacks.               Elemental Damage: Morgott has no Fire or Lightning damage negation. With a Strength build, you can substantially increase your damage against him by imbuing your weapon with a Fire-type Ash of War and using the Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear. You can do the same with a Dexterity build by pairing a Lightning-type Ash of War with Lightning-Shrouding Cracked Tear.\nStatus Ailments: Morgott's resistances are relatively low, and if you can sneak in multiple hits between his attacks with power-stanced small weapons like Daggers or Curved Swords, you can inflict multiple status ailments very quickly. Look for Morgott's Holy Spear throw attack, and run towards his left side (your right) when he's winding it up. You won't even need to dodge, and this will give you a solid chunk chunk of unimpeded attack time. When he starts casting Holy Swords Rain, you can get up to 3 light attacks with a fast weapon before having to roll away to safety. Similarly, keep attacking him through his phase change: although he has much higher damage negation, he still builds up status effects. Roll towards him just as he starts to stand up straight to avoid being caught by his Holy blast and to buy yourself a few more seconds of attacking. Because Morgott is vulnerable to all status ailments but his resistances increase after each proc, triggering as many as possible is a good plan. For example, power-stancing a Frost Great Knife and a Scorpion's Stinger will build Frostbite, Hemorrhage, and Scarlet Rot simultaneously.\n\nMagic and Ranged Users\n Maintaining good distance between you and Morgott is the key, he doesn't have many options when it comes to ranged attacks (Holy Daggers, Holy Spear and Holy Spear Charge or will try to walk towards you after he gets hit by a sorcery or an incantation) You can use super long ranged incantations such as Frenzied Burst and maintain a huge distance almost completely nullifying his moveset or spells that he can't react to like Night Comet (sorceries) or a non charged Lighting Spear (incantations). Drink Flasks during long wind up animations or when you're really far from the boss.\n\nMorgott, The Omen King Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nHoly Swords Rain\nMorgott spawns a holy sword in his left hand as well as holy swords in the air drawing a circle around himself and 5 lines each one being in fixed directions (1 in front of himself, two equally spaced out to his sides and two close ones behind him). This is a scripted attack at the 80% HP threshold\nThis move has a big wind up so you can get a few attacks in before having to run away to safety, unlocking camera and looking a bit upwards helps with dodging the swords \n\nTail Sweep\nWhen the target is behind him, Morgott will twist his tail in an attempt to hit them.\nRoll against the sweep direction or Jump the attack.\n\nCursed Explosion\nAt the 60% HP Threshold, Attacking, Shackling, Parrying Morgott would instantly force the transition animation to second phase where Morgott stands in place with his sword stabbed to the ground, he then starts coughing for a bit before unleashing the omen curse, spawning geysers on the floor that are random and covering the arena with water\nYou can safely attack Morgott until he begins coughing, at which point the safest strategy is to run away to avoid being hit by the blast. You can also roll towards him as soon as he begins standing up straight to push more damage. This is a good opportunity to heal or use ranged attacks to apply status ailments.\n\nHoly Spear Throw\nMorgott spawns a holy spear and throws it towards you after a short delay. \nWhen he starts pulling his arm back to throw, dodge to a side. If you're close enough you can completely dodge the attack by standing in front of his left leg.\n\nFlying Sword Spear Stab\nMorgott leaps into the air stabbing the ground with his spear and sword.\nYou can easily dodge this attack by running towards Morgott after a spear throw. You can also roll behind Morgott when he's at the apex of the jump (when he's closest to you)\n\nFlying Hammer Slam\nMorgott leaps into the air spawning a holy hammer and slamming it into the ground\nYou can outrun this attack or roll into Morgott as he's slamming to continue aggression.\n\nHoly Spear Charge\nCreates a holy spear and after a second, he starts charging directly at his target\nAlthough this attack looks like a mid/long range only attack, Morgott can actually queue it in close range too, delay the roll until he starts moving towards you if that happens to avoid getting clipped by it.You can Roll through this attack (Forward Right),  or run away from the attack Rolling through the spear has 2 outcomes- If you’re in front of the boss he’ll do a Sword Attack - If you’re behind the boss he’ll do a Sword Hammer Horizontal Swing \n\nSpear Poke\nMorgott pulls out a holy spear for a short period of time poking you before following up with a Diagonal Sword Attack if you’re within range for one or idling if you're not\nHe pulls the spear backwards a bit before doing the attack, roll the moment he pulls it back\n\nHoly Daggers\n There are multiple instances where Morgott spawns Holy daggers: 1: Spawns a dagger and does two quick slashes in front of him to start a combo 2: Creates and throws three daggers in a fan formation up to two times. 3: Can spawn a dagger, does one slash and then perform a retreating jump throwing 3 daggers forming a fan towards the player. 4: As a punish for the players after Holy Sword Slash Vertical Sword Slam if they're standing in front of him. After a Sword Front Flip \n1: Roll behind his left leg 2: Roll through the daggers or to a side3: Roll through the first dagger and wait for him to throw the daggers after jumping away and roll through them 4: Roll twice behind his left leg instantly \n\nHoly Sword Slash Vertical Sword Slam\nMorgott hops to your left side or does a backhand Diagonal sword slam before spawning a holy sword in his left hand and doing a quick slash followed by a Vertical sword slam that ends the combo.\nDodge the sword and move towards his left side and only attack after he slams him to avoid the oncoming sword attack. This is a good attack to punish.Attacking before he slams the regular sword can get you hit by the sword hitbox.Dodging the final part of the attack into Morgott will in turn make him spawn a Holy Dagger and slash twice as a punishment for the player.\n\nSpinning Slashes\nMorgott Swings his sword diagonally from left to right quickly before spawning a holy sword in his left hand and doing a triple diagonal spin mid air and slamming both swords on the ground (there is a tiny delay here, Holy Sword goes down first then Regular Sword).\nThere are multiple ways of dodging this attack; Either by rolling into the first sword slash, and rolling twice around Morgott (one forward left, one forward right)Rolling away and getting back in after the slams.Rolling the first sword slash and running around him in a counter clockwise direction for roughly one second before letting go of the sprint button*Strafing the sword slash by going right then running left for a second and stopping the sprint (Advanced Dodge)This attack is a combo finisher and is great for punishes\n\nGliding Slide\nMorgott dashes towards your left then performs a sword slash as he’s dashing from left to right.\nTime your roll when Morgott raises the sword slightly. Dodging with the attack allows for a rolling light attack on most weapons\n\nCartwheel\nMorgott does a flip and positions himself behind you, lunging for a second before jumping back through your body slashing it as he goes.\nTo time this roll, dodge when you can’t see his right hand and when you see the sword above his shoulder. Rolling with him will make him opt to one of 3 options, Helicopter, Sword Poke, or Bloodflame Stab (Only in Phase 2)Rolling away from him will make him opt for  a spear throw, daggers throw, or a spear poke\n\nSword Hammer Horizontal Swing\nMorgott spawns a holy hammer and rests it on his shoulder for a second before doing a sword Slash from right to left followed simultaneously by a hammer swing.\nNotice when Morgott Raises his sword slightly, that’s the tell on when you should queue the roll. Dodging into Morgott gives one of 2 different follow ups, Overhead Hammer Slam or Any of the Sword Attacks.You can tell this attack is going to happen if Morgott points his sword INWARDS. Not to be mistaken with the HORIZONTAL SWORD SLASH, OVERHEAD HAMMER SLAM Variation Where he points his sword OUTWARDS as they have a similar starting animation.\n\nHorizontal Sword Slash, Overhead Hammer Slam\nMorgott spawns a holy hammer and rests it on his shoulder for a second before doing a sword slash from right to left followed by a delayed overhead hammer slam.\nDodge in as he raises the sword then either run behind him and dodge the hammer, or perform a jumping attack on his back to dodge the shockwave and not get clipped by the hammer hitbox\n\nOverhead Hammer Slam\nMorgott pulls his left arm all the way to the back before summoning a holy hammer raising it over his head and slamming the ground creating shockwave\nTo get the maximum value of this attack, maintain a bit of distance so you can roll into him and bait out the Helicopter attack\n\nSword + Hammer Spin\nMorgott spawns a hammer in his right hand, tries to close in on you and then starts spinning twice ending it with a big hammer diagonal slam.\nTo dodge this attack, sprint backwards and the moment you see his sword starting to move, roll away.This attack is pretty tough to dodge depending on your position as he can do a quick hop to catch up to you before starting the animation. Thankfully it has multiple attacks that signal that it's going to happen. Most important one being the Swords Rain. As soon as you see him spawning the hammer when you’re away from him start sprinting backwards to avoid getting into these situations.This attack can happen as a follow up to Spear Throw, out of idle (only in phase 2), or rarely after Double Daggers Throw.If he pulls out a hammer out of idle (Melee Range) in phase 2 DO NOT GO IN, roll away twice instantly\n\nCursed-Blood Slice (Slam)\nMorgott raises his sword in the air infusing it with bloodflame before doing a heavy slam on the ground creating an exploding trail where the sword hit the ground.\nTo get the full value of this attack; stand near his left leg and attack (preferably without lock on so you can keep your positioning), the Slam should completely miss you.\n\nCursed-Blood Slice (Chase)\nMorgott raises his sword in the air infusing it with bloodflame, but this time dashing towards the player doing a big diagonal slash in front of him followed by a small twirl and a second slash in the opposite direction of the first slash leaving bloodflame trails that explode and linger for a second or so after each slash.\nTo Dodge this attack, wait until he starts sprinting towards you then roll twice into Morgott, with a slight delay between each roll\n\nCursed-Blood Thrust\nMorgott pulls back and infuses his sword with bloodflame before dashing towards the player doing a thrust on the way that grabs the player if caught by it, he then will raise the target in the air with his sword before throwing them to the ground.\nTo dodge this attack, simply roll into Morgott the moment he raises his arm a bit to stab you, or if you’re close enough stick to his left side (that way you can get extra punishes without having to worry about dodging)\n\nRapid Armament Change\nRapidly begins attacking with his sword and dagger, before switching to his holy sword, performing more attacks, and finally summoning his hammer, performing a spinning attack and slamming it on the ground. (This attack unlocks at the 30% HP threshold and can be a punish to getting guardbroken by certain attacks)\nYou can dodge the attack by rolling behind Morgott either from the left or the rightYou can dodge it by running behind Morgott then backing off\n\nMorgott, The Omen King Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Anthony Howell\nMorgott is the one of the few bosses that survive the boss battle upon defeat. After winning the battle, the player can approach Morgott (he will be either at the place of defeat or behind the Elden Throne) and listen to the Omen King. After a short monologue about the inevitable failure of the Tarnished, he falls unconscious and later dies as his body fades to gold dust during Godfrey’s introduction, likely symbolizing that he has returned to the Erdtree.\nMorgott is the twin brother of Mohg, Lord of Blood. Morgott does not mention Mohg as a traitor, likely due to the fact that they were both imprisoned underground, and thus Mohg lacks a seat at the Elden Throne.\nUnlike Mohg, he looks comparably more human than his Omen brother, which shows that he despised his true nature and wish to leave it behind.\nMorgott is one of the three sons of Godfrey and Marika, but was shunned, shackled and imprisoned deep below the capital for his Omen nature. Some time during the Shattering he broke free from his underground prison, became the king of Leyndell as the Shrouded Lord and created the second identity of Margit, so he could aid the Leyndell forces in the field without revealing his Omen nature to his subjects.\nHe founded the Night's Cavalry to hunt down champions, knights and tarnished that grew too ambitious and threatened the Erdtree.\nThe Holy Weapons he summons are the Erdsteel Dagger, Treespear, Giant-Crusher, and the Carian Knight's Sword.\nIf parried successfully, the Cursed-Blood Slice will not deal any damage to the player, however, Morgott’s attack animation will not be interrupted and it will not count towards the three parries that are needed to riposte him.\nIn Phase 2, the arena becomes covered in shallow water, giving both the player and Morgott +20 Fire absorption and -20 Lightning absorption.\nIf the player manage to trigger change while Morgott is in air, there is some chance that phase transition will be skipped\n\nMorgott will still get all 2nd phase attacks.\nGround retains old look, no extra dialogue, no reduced damage moment\n\nTo summon someone for this boss who has already defeated Maliketh, the Black Blade and therefore triggered Leyndell, Ashen Capital, the summoned player must use their Small Golden Effigy and they must have interacted with the Summoning Pool near the fog before the capital was made ashen.\nKnown as Morgott, Prince of the Omen in 1.00 version of the game\nBug: Sometimes, phase transition does not change how battle arena looks\n\nDialogue\nIntroduction:\nGraceless Tarnished.\nWhat is thy business with these thrones?\nAhh...
