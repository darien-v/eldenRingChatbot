The Sword of Night and Flame scales primarily with Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Faith and has a powerful Unique Skill, Night-and-Flame Stance, which allows the user to hold the sword level and follow up with a normal attack to cast the Comet Azur sorcery or a strong attack to sweep forward with a burst of flame causing Fire Damage.\n\nStoried sword and treasure of Caria Manor.One of the legendary armaments.\nAstrologers, who preceded the sorcerers, established themselves in mountaintops that nearly touched the sky, and considered the Fire Giants their neighbors.\n\nSword of Night and Flame Location in Elden Ring\nThe Sword of Night and Flame weapon can be found in Caria Manor in a locked room behind the gardens in the east side of the manor.\nBegin at the Manor Lower Level site of grace and proceed east across the rooftops, being wary of any spirit soldiers that may appear. From the first intersection, head north and continue down the pathway until the next junction is reached.\n\nAt this next junction, face north and continue for a few steps.\n\nLooking down over the edge of the walkway (around halfway through to the next junction), you should see a platform containing a ladder. This is your goal -- see image below. You can jump from the walkway down onto the upper roof, then down again to reach the platform where the ladder is.\n\nOnce you've descended the ladder, there will be a chest containing the sword next to a chair near the center of the room.\n\n[Elden Ring Map here] Video Location\n\nElden Ring Sword of Night and Flame Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Night-and-Flame Stance\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nCannot be enchanted with Magic nor boosted by Consumables.\nSword of Night and Flame can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones.\nThis weapon utilizes Thrusting R2s when one-handed, and Slashing R2s when two-handed.  Due to the very low STR scaling, and the superior thrusting moveset, one-handing this weapon is advised in most scenarios\nThe Comet (L2+R1) weapon skill does not count as a sorcery but does inflict magic damage; its damage is affected by the INT portion of the weapon's scaling and weapon level. The night beam is also buffed by the Spellblade Set.\nThe Flame Burst (L2+R2) weapon skill is affected by the FTH portion of the weapon scaling and weapon level.\nAlthough damage from the two weapon art attacks scale with INT or FTH, they do so at a relatively low level, and are still very effective even at minimum stat requirements.  \nSell Value:   1000\nDue to its inherently high FP cost, it's highly recommended to either have high Mind or the Carian Filigreed Crest.  \nOne of the few weapons that can make good use of the Greathood, a very unique piece of armor that provides +2 to INT and FTH.  \nWhen utilized with a high Intelligence build, even the damage from the L2+R1 can be substantial. However, the L2+R2 suffers from a long cast time and is most useful when sneaking up on large packs of enemies.\nThe Confessor starting class starts with exactly 12 Strength and 12 Dexterity, which already meets the minimum Strength and Dexterity requirements of the weapon, allowing one to only invest on Intelligence and Faith for the weapon with the said class.\nThe Astrologer starting class starts with 8 Strength and 12 Dexterity, which meets the Dexterity requirements of the weapon. While requiring 4 more Strength to meet the Strength requirement, can also be used for creating a dedicated SoNaF build without any excessive Strength or Dexterity stat.\nAlthough this weapon deals fire damage, the regular attack damage does not remove the buildup of frostbite (at least in some cases).  While this might seem to limit its function when paired with Frostbite, it actually improves it quite a bit.  Frost procs will reduce enemy defenses, which most of the time is not that useful compared to the large burst damage, however, the SoNaF splits damage between 3 different types, and so is particularly weak against enemies with high defenses.  Attacking into frostbitten enemies will deal significantly more damage than with other weapons.  \n\nIt may be that there are instances where the fire damage from the SoNaF does re-set frostbite, but more testing would be needed to know for sure.\n\nOne of the 9 Legendary Armaments.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, Straight Swords poise damage has been reduced only on PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below. Additionally, the running attack speed, first attack speed and speed of guard counter of straight sword has increased. The attack recovery time has also decreased.\nOther notes and player tips go here.\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for the Sword of Night and Flame\nOne-handed moveset:\n\nLight Attack is a 5-hit combo of diagonal and horizontal strikes, ending in a diagonal downwards slash from right to left\nStrong Attack is a thrust, followed by an uppercut slash on the second input\nCharge Attack is identical to Strong Attack\nRunning Light Attack is a horizontal slash from left to right\nRunning Strong Attack is a downward slam\nBackstep Light Attack is a diagonal slash from left to right\nRolling Attack is a thrust \nJumping Light Attack is a horizontal slash from right to left\nJumping Strong Attack is a downward slam\n\nTwo-handed moveset:\n\nLight Attack is a 5-hit combo of diagonal and vertical strikes, ending in a diagonal downwards slash from right to left\nStrong Attack is a horizontal slash from right to left, followed by a diagonal uppercut slash from left to right on the second input\nCharge Attack is identical to Strong Attack\nRunning Light Attack is a downwards slash\nRunning Strong Attack is a slash from right to left\nBackstep Light Attack is an uppercut slash\nRolling Attack is a thrust\nJumping Light Attack is a horizontal slash from right to left\nJumping Strong Attack is a downward slam\n\nLeft-handed and power-stance moveset:\n\nLeft-handed Light Attack is a 5-hit combo, ending in a downwards slash\nNo rolling, backstep, running, or jumping attacks exist in the left-handed moveset\nPower-stance Light Attack is a cross slash with both weapons, followed by a dual horizontal slash, followed by two staggered thrusts, ending with a diagonal downward slash from left to right\nPower-stance Running Attack is a thrust with the left weapon, followed by a slash with the right weapon\nPower-stance Backstep Attack is a thrust with both weapons\nPower-stance Rolling Attack is a horizontal sweep from left to right with both weapons\nPower-stance Jumping Attack is a cross slash with both weapons\n\nMounted moveset:\n\nLight Attack is a three-hit combo of up-and-down slashes\nStrong Attack is a single uppercut slash\nCharge Attack holds the sword close to the ground, dealing continuous damage, and ends with an uppercut slash.\n\nSword of Night and Flame Buffs\n\nSword of Night and Flame\nBuff Description\nNotes\n\nSpellblade Set\n2% attack power per piece.\nAffects only the night beam.\n\nMagic Scorpion Charm\n+12% Attack Power on magic damage\nIncreases physical damage taken by 10%.\n\nFire Scorpion Charm\n+12% Attack Power on fire damage\nIncreases physical damage taken by 10%.\n\nFlame-Shrouded Cracked Tear\n+20% Attack Power (+15% PvP)\nLasts 3 minutes.\n\nMagic-Shrouded Cracked Tear\n+20% Attack Power (+15% PvP)\nLasts 3 minutes.\n\nTerra Magica\n+35% Attack Power on magic damage\nLasts 30 seconds\n\nAlexander's Shard\n+15% Attack Power\nAffects the magic beam and fire swipe.\n\nWarrior Jar Shard\n+10% Attack Power\nAffects the magic beam and fire swipe.\n\nFlame, Grant Me Strength\n+20% Attack Power on fire damage and physical damage\nLasts 30 seconds\n\nSword Sage Written Guide\n\nDeathblade Written Guide\n\nDeath Knight Written Guide\n\nGolden Sword Sage Written Guide\n\nDeath Mage Written Guide\n\nStraight Swords Showcase\n\nSword of Night and Flame PvP Poise Damage in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations.
