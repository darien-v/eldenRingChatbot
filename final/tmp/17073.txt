Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below. Additionally, speed, range, recovery time and guard counter speed of Curved Greatsword weapons has increased. \nSome jumping attacks of the Bloodhound's Fang have a higher motion value compared to the rest of its class. 1h Jumping R1, 1h Jumping R2, 2h Jumping R1 and 2h Jumping R2 are all affected.  \n\nThe motion values of the Bloodhound's Fang are 118, 142, 128 and 151 respectively, compared to the regular Curved Greatsword motion values of 107, 127, 112 and 132. \n\nMotion value is a term that is, as far as I've been able to find, borrowed from the Monster Hunter series. A motion value is a multiplier to the various properties of attacks represented as a percentage (100 = 100%).If the motion value for an attack is listed as ""X + X"" this is done to separate individual attacks made from one input. The same applies if there is multiplication, done to save space if there are, say, 6 attacks in a row using the same motion value. Combining values from multiple hits will give you misleading comparison values for anything relating to health damage due to the way that is calculated in Fromsoftware's games.
