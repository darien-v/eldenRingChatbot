Unseen Form makes both your character and horse partially invisible, allowing you to move undetected. (This spell reduces the range at which enemies notice you, allowing you to get the drop on some and completely bypass others. They will still notice you and attack if you get too close, and can still hear your footsteps; also, Unseen Form has no effect on some enemies, such as bosses.)\n\nOne of the night sorceries of Sellia, Town of Sorcery. Makes the caster semi-invisible. While on horseback, effect extends to cover the mount. This sorcery can be cast while in motion.The Sellian assassins considered every option that aided their dirty work.\n\nWhere to find Unseen Form\nWhere to find Unseen Form:\nThis Sorcery can be found in Altus Plateau at the top of the Tower after completing the Mirage Rise puzzle. When you reach at the location, although your map marks there is a tower, you will notice that there is nothing there! However, you will receive a map, called Mirage Riddle. You will have to interact with three Phantom crests.\n\nThe first one is next to that initial position, hard to miss.\nThe second one can be found by continuing to the west, near the rock wall. Enemies will spawn.\nThe final one, is near the Bower of Bounty site of grace. Starting at the Bower of Bounty site of grace, head directly south to the edge of a cliff. Here a small enemy will spawn. Once you see this enemy, head east along the cliffside. On the left side you will see a strange looking stone which you have to hit in order to reveal the phantom crest. The stone lies before the bridge and will likely have messages surrounding it.\n\nOnce you found all three, head to where the tower was supposed to be, to actually find it this time. Climb all the way to the top to find this sorcery, along with Unseen Blade and x5 Slumbering Egg.\nElden Ring Interactive Map Link\nElden Ring Unseen Form Notes\n\nNote: While using the Crepus's Vial talisman, you lose invisibility in your appearance but the effect appears to still work on enemies and NPCs. It is unconfirmed whether this issue effects PvP or not.\nReduces lock on range for opponents in PvP\nNight Sorcery\nStamina Cost: 10\nDuration: 30 seconds\nNote: Wearing the Black Knife Armor removes the visual effect, but the invisibility effect will still be active. \n\nBuilds with Unseen Form\n\nDarkmoon Spellblade Written Guide\n\nSoul Samurai Written Guide\n\nSanguine Spellblade Written Guide\n\nSilent Spearcaller Written Guide\n\nElden Ring Sorceries\n\nAdula's Moonblade  ♦  Ambush Shard  ♦  Briars of Punishment  ♦  Briars of Sin  ♦  Cannon of Haima  ♦  Carian Greatsword  ♦  Carian Phalanx  ♦  Carian Piercer  ♦  Carian Retaliation  ♦  Carian Slicer  ♦  Collapsing Stars  ♦  Comet  ♦  Comet Azur  ♦  Crystal Barrage  ♦  Crystal Burst  ♦  Crystal Release  ♦  Crystal Torrent  ♦  Eternal Darkness  ♦  Explosive Ghostflame  ♦  Fia's Mist  ♦  Founding Rain of Stars  ♦  Freezing Mist  ♦  Frozen Armament  ♦  Gavel of Haima  ♦  Gelmir's Fury  ♦  Glintblade Phalanx  ♦  Glintstone Arc  ♦  Glintstone Cometshard  ♦  Glintstone Icecrag  ♦  Glintstone Pebble  ♦  Glintstone Stars  ♦  Gravity Well  ♦  Great Glintstone Shard  ♦  Great Oracular Bubble  ♦  Greatblade Phalanx  ♦  Loretta's Greatbow  ♦  Loretta's Mastery  ♦  Lucidity  ♦  Magic Downpour  ♦  Magic Glintblade  ♦  Magma Shot  ♦  Meteorite  ♦  Meteorite of Astel  ♦  Night Comet  ♦  Night Maiden's Mist  ♦  Night Shard  ♦  Oracle Bubbles  ♦  Rancorcall  ♦  Ranni's Dark Moon  ♦  Rennala's Full Moon  ♦  Rock Blaster  ♦  Rock Sling  ♦  Roiling Magma  ♦  Rykard's Rancor  ♦  Scholar's Armament  ♦  Scholar's Shield  ♦  Shard Spiral  ♦  Shatter Earth  ♦  Shattering Crystal  ♦  Star Shower  ♦  Starlight  ♦  Stars of Ruin  ♦  Swift Glintstone Shard  ♦  Terra Magica  ♦  Thop's Barrier  ♦  Thops's Barrier (Spell)  ♦  Tibia's Summons  ♦  Unseen Blade  ♦  Zamor Ice Storm (Spell)\n\n

QUESTION
Why is Unseen Form a valuable sorcery in Elden Ring and how does it impact gameplay strategies?

ANSWER
Unseen Form is valuable in Elden Ring as it makes the caster semi-invisible, reducing enemy notice range, helping in stealth tactics and bypassing enemies; however, it does not work on all enemies and has no effect on some, such as bosses.
