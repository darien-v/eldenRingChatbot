The Night Maiden's Mist spell creates a dense mist before the caster, which deals damage to everything within it.\n\nOne of the night sorceries of Sellia, Town of Sorcery.\nReleases a life-sapping silver mist before the caster, dealingdamage to all caught within, including the caster.This sorcery can be cast while in motion.\nBelow Sellia, the Eternal City of Nokron sleeps. This sorceryoriginates from the maiden of that place.\n\nWhere to find Night Maiden's Mist\nWhere to find Night Maiden's Mist:\n\nCan be purchased from Gowry for 5,000 Runes after completing his quest line.\n\nElden Ring Night Maiden's Mist Guide\n\nNight Sorcery\nStamina Cost: 0\nDeals standard physical damage\nDuration: 17 seconds\nDoes about 1,500 damage overall.\nCasting the spell will initially shoot a ball of mist, which will generate a cloud of mist over an area if it comes into contact with a wall, floor, enemy, or object. It will also generate the mist after it travels a few seconds in the air without touching anything.\nFrom the time the spell strikes to the time the mist clears is 15 seconds. It may continue to damage briefly after the spell itself ends. \n\nIt also continues dealing damage for a few more ticks even if the target has left the radius of the spell.\n\nCan be charged, increasing the radius of the cloud, but not the damage or duration. \n\nThe radius increase is roughly double of the normal radius. It may be slightly less. \nGodfrey Icon does not affect this spell in any way, even if charged.\n\nThis spell deals damage to all targets, including yourself. The sole exception appears to be friendly players in co-op. Use with caution! \n\nHowever it cannot destroy physical objects, nor can it destroy skull-like deposits on Walking Mausoleums.\n\nThe mist can attack enemies through walls and objects. It can be used to kill hosts glitched under terrain or inside walls during invasions.\nThe mist lingers for its full duration even after death (until the loading screen), so if a boss has low health but you think you might not make it, you can cast it at your feet, or run into an existing mist and hopefully it will bring down the boss with you. \n\nThe boss has to actually be defeated and give you its rewards, otherwise this is pointless.\n\nCan be cast as a level 1 (Wretch) character with enough intelligence boosting gear and low requirement staves: \n\nHeadgear: Karolos Glintstone Crown, Olivinus Glintstone Crown or Twinsage Glintstone Crown.\nTalismans: Marika's Scarseal, Marika's Soreseal or Stargazer Heirloom.\nStaves: Glintstone Staff, Demi-Human Queen's Staff or Digger's Staff.\nEarly options: Olivinus Glintstone Crown, Marika's Scarseal, and Glintstone Staff. These can be all obtained with little effort involved other than traveling and running past enemies.\n\nThis spell is very effective for guarding ladders. The direct impact area (about the size of an uncharged spell radius or smaller) will knock enemies down, but the mist will also slowly sap their HP.\nMultiple clouds of Night Maiden Mist do not stack: \n\nIn single-player and multiplayer, the person casting a cloud after one is already present will cancel the previous cloud.\nIf multiple players on co-op are casting this spell, they will not make each other's clouds dissapear. However, the damage will not stack even if multiple clouds are in one place. \n\nEach player casting a cloud over a wide area does effectively extend the Area of Effect of the spell, even if the damage does not stack.\n\nUnlike the Dark Souls 3 variant of this spell (Pestilent Mist), this spell can aggro enemy mobs, making it unsuitable for stealth, even if using Unseen Form.\n\nElden Ring Sorceries\n\nAdula's Moonblade  ♦  Ambush Shard  ♦  Briars of Punishment  ♦  Briars of Sin  ♦  Cannon of Haima  ♦  Carian Greatsword  ♦  Carian Phalanx  ♦  Carian Piercer  ♦  Carian Retaliation  ♦  Carian Slicer  ♦  Collapsing Stars  ♦  Comet  ♦  Comet Azur  ♦  Crystal Barrage  ♦  Crystal Burst  ♦  Crystal Release  ♦  Crystal Torrent  ♦  Eternal Darkness  ♦  Explosive Ghostflame  ♦  Fia's Mist  ♦  Founding Rain of Stars  ♦  Freezing Mist  ♦  Frozen Armament  ♦  Gavel of Haima  ♦  Gelmir's Fury  ♦  Glintblade Phalanx  ♦  Glintstone Arc  ♦  Glintstone Cometshard  ♦  Glintstone Icecrag  ♦  Glintstone Pebble  ♦  Glintstone Stars  ♦  Gravity Well  ♦  Great Glintstone Shard  ♦  Great Oracular Bubble  ♦  Greatblade Phalanx  ♦  Loretta's Greatbow  ♦  Loretta's Mastery  ♦  Lucidity  ♦  Magic Downpour  ♦  Magic Glintblade  ♦  Magma Shot  ♦  Meteorite  ♦  Meteorite of Astel  ♦  Night Comet  ♦  Night Shard  ♦  Oracle Bubbles  ♦  Rancorcall  ♦  Ranni's Dark Moon  ♦  Rennala's Full Moon  ♦  Rock Blaster  ♦  Rock Sling  ♦  Roiling Magma  ♦  Rykard's Rancor  ♦  Scholar's Armament  ♦  Scholar's Shield  ♦  Shard Spiral  ♦  Shatter Earth  ♦  Shattering Crystal  ♦  Star Shower  ♦  Starlight  ♦  Stars of Ruin  ♦  Swift Glintstone Shard  ♦  Terra Magica  ♦  Thop's Barrier  ♦  Thops's Barrier (Spell)  ♦  Tibia's Summons  ♦  Unseen Blade  ♦  Unseen Form  ♦  Zamor Ice Storm (Spell)\n\n
