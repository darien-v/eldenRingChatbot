Life sprouts from death, as it does from birth.

To access it, you must light all six obelisks by the stairs to the Hallowhorn Grounds northeast of the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace. When you've done so, the deer carcass at the back of the temple will glow and you can interact with it to teleport just outside the boss's arena. Walk through the fog gate to fight the boss.\nThe altars you need to activate can be found in the following places (see the main Nokron, Eternal City wiki for more information):\n\nBy the cliff's edge, next to the broken bridge from the Mimic Tear Site of Grace. [Map Link]\nBy the side of the brick road, due east of the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 1169 / 1626\nScarlet Rot: 1169 / 1626\nHemorrhage: 1169 / 1626\nFrostbite: 1169 / 1626\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

QUESTION
How can players access the Regal Ancestor Spirit boss arena in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
To access the Regal Ancestor Spirit boss arena in Elden Ring, players must light all six obelisks by the stairs to the Hallowhorn Grounds northeast of the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace, causing the deer carcass at the back of the temple to glow, allowing for teleportation just outside the boss's arena through interaction.
