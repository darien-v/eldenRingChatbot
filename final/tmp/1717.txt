A Deathbird is a bipedal bird with a decrepit appearance wielding a long fire poker and is found in various locations, but only at night. They share a close resemblance with the Death Rite Bird but cannot wield magic and are much weaker than their larger winged cousins. This is an optional boss as players do not have to defeat it to advance.\n\n The Deathbirds are graveyard fire keepers; it is said they rake out the ashen remains of the dead from their kilns.\n\nWhere to find Deathbird in Elden Ring\nDeathbird can be found in:\n\nWarmaster's Shack [More Info] [Map Link]\nWeeping Peninsula [More Info] [Map Link]\nScenic Isle [More Info] [Map Link]\nCapital Outskirts [More Info] [Map Link]\n\nDeathbird Combat information\n\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\n Undead type\nDamage: Standard, Pierce, Magic\nInflicts: Death Blight\nWeak spot: head\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: -40\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 40\nHoly: -40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Deathbird Boss Guide\n\n Deathbird Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Deathbird:\n\nHoly Water Pots can take advantage of its weakness to Holy damage and the pots' inherent 400% damage bonus against  Undead enemies to do massive damage even at low Faith\nThe Sacred Blade skill is another great way for non-Faith builds to do Holy damage\nStay on foot rather than riding Torrent. A Deathbird can leap a great distance, and the reach on its poker is long enough to clip you even when you're running at full speed on Torrent. Even ranged players should try to stay just outside the range of its swings, and keep the flexibility to dodge out of the way when it attacks\n\nMelee Users\nStay close to its hind legs, time your dodges, and get a few swings in after every attack. Don't get greedy and attack more than a few times.\nO Holy Fight: Because Deathbirds are both  Undead and weak to Holy damage, melee builds with high Faith will have a particularly easy time defeating them. The Order's Blade sorcery is easy to get and will give your weapon a tremendous damage boost against this boss.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nIt's Litany: For Faith-based magic builds, Litany of Proper Death will make short work of this fight. Because Deathbirds are both  Undead and weak to Holy damage, it will do a whopping 1400% extra damage. Just be aware that it will only work when the Deathbird is touching the ground, so time the incantation carefully.\n\nDeathbird Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwing\nSwings its poker in various directions\nRoll through the swing\n\nHop & Swing\nTakes a long gliding hop to one side to close distance, then swings its poker\nWait for the hop to finish then roll through the swing\n\nJab\nPulls its poker back on its left side in a fencing stance, then stabs it forward\nThis always ends a combo, so roll forward and get in a hit\n\nStab\nPulls its poker back on its right side, then stabs it forward\nDodge roll forward to get behind the Deathbird and avoid the shockwave if it follows with a Yank, but be aware it could combo into a different move\n\nYank\nAfter a Stab, pulls its poker back towards it creating a small shockwave\nSame strategy as with the Stab attack.\n\nPeck\nPecks downward with its beak. Used if you're standing underneath it\nRoll behind the Deathbird and get in a hit\n\nSlam\nSlams its poker on the ground, creating a shockwave. Only ever used after a clockwise swing\nRoll behind the Deathbird and get in a hit\n\nFist Slam\nRaises its left arm and slams it into the ground, creating a small shockwave\nRoll behind the Deathbird and get in a hit\n\nLeaping Slam\nJumps into the air, raises its poker, and slams it into the ground creating a shockwave\nRoll behind the Deathbird once the poker is horizontal. Be careful with the timing, because this attack does a lot of damage if it hits\n\nTwo-Handed Slam\nGrabs the head of the poker with its left hand, stands upright, then slams it into the ground doing damage in a small area\nRoll when you see its left foot leave the ground, and try to end up behind it so you can take advantage of this attack's long recovery time to get in a few hits\n\nScreaming Grab\nLeaps backwards, screams, then lunges forward to grab you with its mouth. Once grabbed, it pecks you into the ground several times\nDodge backwards once you see it scream.\n\nDeath Screech\nScreams, dealing a small amount of damage in an area and quickly building Death Blight\nRoll away once you see it starting to scream and stay away in case it screams again.\n\nDeathbird Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThe Deathbirds are said to have been born from a “Twinbird,” said to be the envoy for an outer god, a role similar to the vassal beast for the Greater Will\n\nDeathbird Combo Chart\n\n Deathbird  Warmaster's Shack  \n\nDrops\n2,800Blue-Feathered Branchsword\n\nHP\n3,442\n\nElden Ring Deathbird Boss (Warmaster's Shack)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Warmaster's Shack\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou cannot normally summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss, unless you lure it to a nearby location that allows spirit summoning\n\nDeathbird Location\nThe Deathbird can be found east of the Warmaster's Shack, just over the cliff to the south. As with all Deathbirds, it only appears at night.
