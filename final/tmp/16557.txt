The Ripple Blade scales primarily with Arcane and is a good Weapon for those users with high Arcane stat, as the Ripple Blade's damage increases with players' Arcane attribute. \n\nUnique weapon wielded by young Albinaurics, this sword ismodelled after the ripples that are thought to be the origin of theirspecies.\nIts attack power is greatly enhanced with one's arcane attribute.\n\nWhere to Find Ripple Blade in Elden Ring\nThe Ripple Blade weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nSold by Pidia, Carian Servant at Caria Manor: on a balcony above the Manor Lower Level bonfire. Only accessible by dropping down the cliffs from the southwestern side of the Three Sisters sub-area. Elden Ring Map Link\nCan be purchased from the Twin Maiden Husks after offering Pidia's Bell Bearing.\n\nElden Ring Ripple Blade Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Wild Strikes Swing armament with wild abandon. Hold to continue swinging. Can be followed tip with a normal or strong attack.\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War, but CAN be buffed with Magic and Consumables.\nRipple Blade can be upgraded by using Smithing Stones\nThis weapon has unique R1 and R2 chains, shared with the Warped Axe.\nSell Value:   100.\nAt 60 arcane/+25 (525 AR) the only other occult axes that beat it are Jawbone Axe /Sacrificial Axe (533 AR), the Iron Cleaver (546 AR) and the Warped Axe (599 AR but you are looking at 10+ levels of stat investment to use it).\nThis a weapon and the Ripple Crescent Halberd are practically made for greasing because of their S scaling in Arcane and ability to be buffed by consumables\n\nGrease Statistics\n\nKeep in mind that the only greases that scale with Arcane are: Blood Greases, Poison Greases, and Soporific Greases\nStatus Grease Build-Up with +25 Ripple Blade and 45 Arcane: \n\nPoison Grease - 193\nDrawstring Poison Grease - 245\nBlood Grease - 91\nDrawstring Blood Grease - 116\nSoporific Grease - 101\nDrawstring Soporific Grease - 128\n\nStatus Grease Build-Up with +25 Ripple Blade and 60 Arcane: \n\nPoison Grease - 219\nDrawstring Poison Grease - 278\nBlood Grease - 104\nDrawstring Blood Grease - 132\nSoporific Grease - 114\nDrawstring Soporific Grease - 146\n\nStatus Grease Build-Up with +25 Ripple Blade and 80 Arcane: \n\nPoison Grease - 228\nDrawstring Poison Grease - 289\nBlood Grease - 108\nDrawstring Blood Grease - 137\nSoporific Grease - 119\nDrawstring Soporific Grease - 152\n\nThe Ripple Blade has better Status Grease Build-Up then the Ripple Crescent Halberd, but has abysmal reach and an inherently worse moveset. Also the extra status is overkill in PvP because both weapons already apply sleep and poison in just two hits with their respective drawstring greases.\nThis weapon is one of the few that can benefit from both arcane and faith stats (the others being Ripple Crescent Halberd and Varré's Bouquet) due to its innate arcane scaling and that it can be buffed (for instance with electrify armament) for faith scaling. This makes it a good option for a character using dragon communion incantations.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, the speed and distance of some attacks have been increased and the recovery time has been reduced. Also, the stagger damage of Axes’ guard counters has been increased. PVP's poise damage has also been reduced with this patch.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
