CONTEXT
\n\n Radagon's Soreseal \n\nWeight\n0.8\n\nEffect \n\nRaises  \n       Vigor,  \n       Endurance,  \n       Strength, and  \n       Dexterity by 5 each, but increases damage taken by 15% \n\nRadagon's Soreseal is a Talisman in Elden Ring. Radagon's Soreseal raises Vigor, Endurance, Strength, and Dexterity by 5 each, but increases damage taken by 15%. Easily confused with the separate talisman: Radagon's Scarseal. Players can use talismans in Elden Ring to boost a variety of Stats.\n\nThis legendary talisman is an eye engraved with an Elden Rune, said to be the seal of King Consort Radagon.\nGreatly raises vigor, endurance, strength, dexterity, but also increases damage taken by a similar measure.\nSolemn duty weighs upon the one beholden; not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance.\n\nRadagon's Soreseal Effect in Elden Ring\nRadagon's Soreseal raises Vigor, Endurance, Strength, and Dexterity by 5 each, but increases damage taken by 15%\n\nWhere to find Radagon's Soreseal in Elden Ring\n\nFort Faroth: Found on a corpse by dropping down an opening from the roof and exploring around the wooden walkways. [Map Link]\n\nFrom the Fort Faroth Site of Grace, run into the fort and pass the bats and harpies. Climb up the ladder, make a right and jump down the scaffolding onto the roof. Run past the first two big holes on the floor; go down the ladder of the third one. Facing away from the ladder, follow the wall to your immediate right until it ends and you find some planks resting on it. Break the planks and jump to the room they were hiding. Continue past the big rat and jump down where the ladder is. Facing away from the ladder, turn left twice and you'll find the Talisman on the corpse.\n\nElden Ring Radagon's Soreseal Notes & Tips\n\nSell Value:  3,000\nIncompatible with Radagon's Scarseal.\nFlat increases to attribute points are more impactful in the early-game. For example, a level 1 wretch would see an increase of about 26% more health and a 16% increase in maximum equip load, effectively offsetting the 15% damage taken penalty. While a character at 55 in both Vigor and Endurance (therefore reaching the upper soft caps of 60) would only see an increase of about 5% health and 7% equip load, making it not worth using a talisman slot especially since you would have better talismans that late in the game.\nTo determine if a soreseal is worth using, consider not only the item's penalty, but also the opportunity cost of a talisman slot. A player who replaces their soreseal talisman with a mere Crimson Amber Medallion will not only cease to take 15% more damage, but also gain 8% more HP. Cumulatively, this brings them from 100/115% to 108/100% effective HP, which constitutes a 24.2% increase when dividing the newer fraction by the former. This is the difference between dying in four hits and five, so if a build's last 20 levels don't give a 25% increase to health, damage, or something of equal value (20% absorption lowers 125% damage to 100), it is better to remove those levels to strip the soreseal off. Typically, this makes the soreseal not worth using by level 80 to 100, where most builds should be nearing their first damage cap.\n\nDragon Knight Written Guide\n\nThundering Sword Spear Written Guide\n\nBlasphemous Beastmaster Written Guide\n\nRoyal Knight Written Guide\n\nBlackflame Bushido Written Guide\n\nLightning Dragoon Written Guide\n\nTest Data for Radagon's Soreseal (MAY NOT BE ACCURATE SEE DISCLAIMER)\nDISCLAIMER: The data and test below WHILE VALID ignore the simple fact that Radagon's Soreseal reduces all dmg negation by 15% FLAT. There fore the damage taken will always be proportional to your REMAINING DEFENSIVE STATS, AND THUS REDUCED WITH HIGHER STATS AND ARMOR.\nBelow are test results to determine the damage increase received by Radagon’s Soreseal. Method was to receive a certain type of attack twice, once with the talisman equipped, one unequipped, with a full heal in between. The enemies were chosen to represent a variety from early game to end game, and to get as wide a range of numbers as possible. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS TESTING IS NOT CATEGORICALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL POSSIBILITES.  Just as in all things Elden Ring, factor your build into determining if this talisman is right for you.\n-With Soreseal: Phys.

Low base attack damage results in a lower percentage of damage increase, where higher base attack damage results in a higher percentage of damage increase. Note, however, that not all of the percentage increase in these tests comes from the talisman - Some is coming from the way Elden Ring calculates received damage.\nIt seems safe to estimate that Radagon’s Soreseal increases received damage by around 12-13%, with some outliers; inconsistencies are inevitable. Importantly, though, is that your Hits to KO stays the same, or even increases with the talisman equipped; Therefore, paired with its other stat-boosting effects, survivability is increased considerably with Radagon’s Scarseal/Soreseal.\nNEW TEST RESULTS reveal that going past the vigor softcap (40) gives diminishing returns for effective health (Hits to KO). Past 40 VIG, this talisman's efficacy in regards to character durability may decrease drastically.\n23% DMG NEG TEST- With Soreseal: Phys Def/Dmg Neg = 130/23.032 Max HP 1216\n- Without Soreseal: 123/33.071 Max HP 994\nGodrick Swordsman, Light right swing\n\n1216 - 1175 = 41 dmg; Hits to KO = 29.6 (30)\n- 994 - 957 = 37 dmg; Hits to KO = 26.8 (27)\n\n40 VIG TEST-With Soreseal: Phys Def/Dmg Neg = 130/5.594 Max HP 1581 (Vigor 40+5)\n-Without Soreseal: Phys Def/Dmg Neg = 123/17.908 Max HP 1450\nGodrick Swordsman, Light right swing\n\n1581 - 1531 = 50 dmg; Hits to KO = 31.6 (32)\n- 1450 - 1405 = 45 dmg; Hits to KO = 32.2 (33)\n\nCOMBINED TESTWith Soreseal: Phys Def/Dmg Neg = 130/23.032 Max HP 1581\nWithout Soreseal: Phys Def/Dmg Neg = 123/33.071 Max HP 1450\nGodrick Swordsman, Light right swing\n\n1581 - 1540 = 41 dmg; Hits to KO = 38.5 (39)\n- 1450 - 1413 = 37 dmg; Hits to KO = 39.2 (40)\n\nElden Ring Talismans\n\nAncestral Spirit's Horn  ♦  Arrow's Reach Talisman  ♦  Arrow's Sting Talisman  ♦  Arsenal Charm  ♦  Assassin's Cerulean Dagger  ♦  Assassin's Crimson Dagger  ♦  Axe Talisman  ♦  Blessed Dew Talisman  ♦  Blue Dancer Charm  ♦  Blue-Feathered Branchsword  ♦  Boltdrake Talisman  ♦  Bull-Goat's Talisman  ♦  Carian Filigreed Crest  ♦  Cerulean Amber Medallion  ♦  Cerulean Seed Talisman  ♦  Clarifying Horn Charm  ♦  Claw Talisman  ♦  Companion Jar  ♦  Concealing Veil  ♦  Crimson Amber Medallion  ♦  Crimson Seed Talisman  ♦  Crucible Knot Talisman  ♦  Crucible Scale Talisman  ♦  Curved Sword Talisman  ♦  Daedicar's Woe  ♦  Dagger Talisman  ♦  Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman  ♦  Dragoncrest Shield Talisman  ♦  Entwining Umbilical Cord  ♦  Erdtree's Favor  ♦  Fire Scorpion Charm  ♦  Flamedrake Talisman  ♦  Flock's Canvas Talisman  ♦  Furled Finger's Trick-Mirror  ♦  Godfrey Icon  ♦  Godskin Swaddling Cloth  ♦  Golden Scarab  ♦  Graven-Mass Talisman  ♦  Graven-School Talisman  ♦  Great-Jar's Arsenal  ♦  Greatshield Talisman  ♦  Green Turtle Talisman  ♦  Haligdrake Talisman  ♦  Hammer Talisman  ♦  Hosts' Trick-Mirror  ♦  Immunizing Horn Charm  ♦  Kindred of Rot's Exultation  ♦  Lance Talisman  ♦  Lightning Scorpion Charm  ♦  Longtail Cat Talisman  ♦  Lord of Blood's Exultation  ♦  Magic Scorpion Charm  ♦  Marika's Scarseal  ♦  Marika's Soreseal  ♦  Millicent's Prosthesis  ♦  Moon of Nokstella  ♦  Mottled Necklace  ♦  Old Lord's Talisman  ♦  Pearldrake Talisman  ♦  Perfumer's Talisman  ♦  Prince of Death's Cyst  ♦  Prince of Death's Pustule  ♦  Radagon's Scarseal  ♦  Radagon Icon  ♦  Red-Feathered Branchsword  ♦  Ritual Shield Talisman  ♦  Ritual Sword Talisman  ♦  Roar Medallion  ♦  Rotten Winged Sword Insignia  ♦  Sacred Scorpion Charm  ♦  Sacrificial Twig  ♦  Shabriri's Woe  ♦  Shard of Alexander  ♦  Silver Scarab  ♦  Spear Talisman  ♦  Spelldrake Talisman  ♦  Stalwart Horn Charm  ♦  Starscourge Heirloom  ♦  Taker's Cameo  ♦  Twinblade Talisman  ♦  Two Fingers Heirloom  ♦  Viridian Amber Medallion  ♦  Warrior Jar Shard  ♦  Winged Sword Insignia\n\n

QUESTION
Why might someone question the effectiveness of using Radagon's Soreseal talisman in the late game of Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Radagon's Soreseal's effectiveness in the late game of Elden Ring may be questioned due to diminishing returns beyond certain attribute levels, making its damage increase penalty not worth the stat boosts it provides.
