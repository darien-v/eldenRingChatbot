Tarnished, just like you. Let me ask you something. Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight? Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm, despite the collapse of the Golden Order?\n\nIf "My faith holds firm" option is chosen\n\nYes, you're a Tarnished through and through. Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever. Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.\n\nIf "I'm not sure" option is chosen\n\nHonest to a fault, I see. Such thoughts won't behoove you as a Tarnished. But there’s nothing wrong with that. Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.\n\nSmall Talk\n\nThere's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover. Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died. A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance. That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat. It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.\n\nOther\n\nNo Purchase Made: Not floating your boat, eh? Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day.\nPurchase Made: Well, until we meet again.\nAfter Purchasing and selecting 'leave': Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy.\n\nWhen attacked\n\n(Combat) I suppose I have no choice, then. Is this what grace would have of us?\n(On player kill) Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished.\n\nUpon defeat\n\nYou are an enigma, to be certain. The Volcano Manor awaits you.\n\nAt Volcano Manor\n\nYou... What in heaven's name are you doing here? The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind. I hope you understand the weight of my words.\n(I don't understand) Then get out of here immediately. The faint of heart have nothing to do here.\n(Repeat the dialog) I told you to leave. Or do you want to say that you understand... What does it mean to be a recusant who defiles grace and kills his relatives?\n(I understand) Well. As long as you understand what you're saying. I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue. Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder. But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and lead only to a miserable death. Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.\n\nAfter completing one Volcano Manor quest\n\nSo. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt. Then I shall introduce myself once more.Bernahl, a recusant, just like you. Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.Why not add some to your repertoire?\nTo take power and make it his own, The recusant must hunt his own kind. To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging. We recusants must become the most wretched of predators. All you can do is laugh.\n\nAfter completing two Volcano Manor quest\n\nLook at you. A recusant through and through. I knew you had it in you. Take this.[You receive the Letter to Bernahl]\nA special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold.If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle.\n\nAfter completing his quest\n\nAh, I had hoped you'd soon return. I have the reward from Lady Tanith.Take it. It's yours, by right.\nLet us tread the path of the recusant together. Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us.\n\nAfter defeating Rykard\n\nSo. You killed Rykard? I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code.Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more. Though we may yet fulfil an old promise.We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs. And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.\nO Greater Will, hear my voice. I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade.We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning.\n\nElden Ring Knight Bernahl Notes & Trivia\n\nIf it's  nighttime, and Knight Bernahl is not inside the Warmaster's Shack, entering will instead spawn a field boss named Bell Bearing Hunter.\nIf you do not talk to Bernahl at all he will never leave the Manor and never invade you. You can return to him at any point to exhaust his dialogue. He will then disappear from the Manor and invade you at Crumbling Farum Azula.\nIf Bernahl is provoked while at the Warmaster's Shack, he wields a Zweihander and a Sacred Seal.\nCan buff himself by casting Golden Vow.\nAs an invader, can heal 1 time.\nAfter he moves to Volcano Manor, he uses the Devourer's Scepter instead of a Zweihander. \n\nAs a knight, deals Standard and Pierce Damage.\nAs a recusant, deals Strike and Fire Damage. \n\nKnight Bernahl Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
