These heavily armored knights ride large steeds and carry powerful halberds. Although players are likely to encounter one in their first steps out into the Lands Between, it's wise to leave it be at first and return stronger and more experienced. They are optional bosses, as players don't need to defeat them in order to advance in Elden Ring.\n\n The living rampart of the Erdtree, the Tree Sentinels are the standard to which all defenders of the Erdtree aspire.\n\nWhere to find Tree Sentinel in Elden Ring\nTree Sentinel can be found in:\n\nLimgrave [More Info] [Map Link]\nAltus Plateau [More Info] [Map Link]\n\nTree Sentinel Combat information\n\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nImmune to critical attacks. Breaking its stance or parrying it will only stun it briefly. Hitting him in this state pushes him back and deals 10% more damage.\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 40\nLightning: 0 (-10 while raining)\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\nTree Sentinel Boss Guide for Elden Ring\n\nVideo Guide for Tree Sentinel Boss\n\nTree Sentinel Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Tree Sentinel:\n\nFighting on horseback is a great option for extra mobility and ease of escaping the Sentinel's combos.\nUse a shield with 100% physical negation like Heater Shield, in combination with Green Turtle Talisman and Pickled Turtle Necks to keep your stamina bar high\nDon't expect to defeat this boss as soon as you see him, especially if this is your first experience playing a From Software game. Try exploring the region and come back once you've leveled up and found more powerful gear.\n\nMelee Strategy\nIn and Out: Wait for Tree Sentinel to finish an attack and get in a quick hit or two before rolling away to avoid the follow-up. Allow it to approach you again and repeat. A good shield can help buy you time to escape, especially since many of its attacks have substantially different timings so learning how to dodge them all is challenging. Once it enters Phase 2, be sure to preserve enough stamina to run away and roll when it starts winding up a Shield Crush.\nShield and Poke: Any weapon with a thrusting light attack, such as Short Spears or Rapiers, can be used while guarding. Stand to Tree Sentinel's right and a little towards its hind leg, so that some of its attacks swing over your head and miss. Stay as close as possible, keep your shield up whenever possible, and poke with thrusting attacks. You'll still get hit sometimes which will drain your stamina, but the gaps between its attacks tend to be long enough for you to recharge your stamina. Only lower your shield in order to close distance. This strategy allows you to avoid learning dodge timings except for distance-closing moves like Charging Attack and Leap Attack. Once his health bar reaches 25%, you can summon Lone Wolf Ashes to whittle down the remainder of its health.\nParries: Almost all of Tree Sentinel's most frequent attacks are parriable, but the timing is tricky for many of the normal Side Swings. The easiest way to defeat it with parries is to learn the timing for Charging Attack and Leap Attack specifically, then stand a ways away to bait those. Once you land a parry, hit it with a charged heavy attack and then back off to provoke another Charging Attack or Leap Attack. Once it hits Phase 2 you'll need to be able to dodge its Shield Crush move as well, but it'll do that less frequently than its more punishable moves.\n RL1 Wretch: Use Barbaric Roar and then perform jumping attacks whenever Tree Sentinel is after an attack. With Low weight Tarnished can still survive most of the attacks and has a fastroll, which allows to escape difficult situations with ease. \nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nAlthough Tree Sentinel's Golden Retaliation ability can make magic strategies frustrating at first, its attacks are very telegraphed. So once you learn when it's safe to shoot it, the fight gets much easier. Use a shield to block if necessary, then focus on keeping your distance and shooting it when it's in the middle of an attack. If you're using a spell with shorter range, like Carian Slicer or Catch Flame, then you'll need to play more like a melee build and follow up his attacks with these spells. \nYou can use horseback to make this fight even easier as long as your spells have enough range. Just be careful not to cast a spell while it prepares Golden Retaliation.\n\nAttacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSide Swing\nSwings its halberd in various directions on its right flank\nRolling into the swing will usually position you towards the front or back of the horse, which will give you a chance to get in a hit before the next attack. You can also roll away to get some distance and provoke a Charging Attack or a Leap Attack\n\nStab\nStabs its halberd forward\nRoll to your right to end up on its more vulnerable left flank\n\nHorse Bash\nThe steed throws itself suddenly to its right, often leaving one open to another attack.\nThis is hard to dodge since it happens so fast. Your best bet is to avoid lingering on the right flank, and instead try to stick to the front or back\n\nRearing Slam\nRears up, then slams down its halberd in front of it creating a small shockwave.\nGet in a hit while the horse is rearing, then roll to your right to avoid the halberd\n\nRearing Swing\nRears up, then swings its halberd counterclockwise. It will always start the fight with a particularly slow version of this move\nGet in a hit while the horse is rearing, then roll to your right to avoid the swing\n\nHoof Attack\nRears up, then slams down its hooves. This is the only attack where its hooves themselves deal damage.\nGet in a hit while the horse is rearing, then roll to either side\n\nCharging Attack\nRuns towards you and swings its halberd clockwise once it gets close. Usually uses this when you're far away\nRoll into it once it gets close. It will usually keep running some distance after swinging, so this is a good chance to heal, cast spells, or reposition\n\nLeap Attack\nJumps towards you while swinging its halberd clockwise. Usually uses this when you're a medium distance away\nRoll in the direction it's moving to minimize the chance the halberd will hit you and position yourself to attack after it lands\n\nTwirling Swing\nTurns around, rears up, then does a far-reaching counterclockwise swing. Often used after a combo when the player is retreating\nBe careful when you retreat and keep enough stamina to roll when it does the final swing\n\nGolden Retaliation\nShield: The Sentinel raises its shield in response to projectile spells. If the spell hits the shield, it counters by firing a beam back at the attacker, dealing holy damage.\nEither avoid ranged combat entirely, focus on spells that don't use projectiles, or carefully time your spells for when the Tree Sentinel is in the middle of another attack.\n\nTorch Swing\nTorch: Swings its torch in various directions on its left flank\nRoll into the swing. The torch attacks aren't part of combos, so there's a slightly wider window of opportunity to get in attacks\n\nTorch Slam\nTorch: Slams its torch down parallel to its left flank\nRoll away\n\nTorch Stab\nTorch: Rears up, then stabs its torch forward\nGet in a quick hit while it's rearing, then roll to your left to avoid the stab\n\nPhase 2\n\nShield Bash\nShield: Raises its shield and slams it into the player\nRoll to either side of the shield\n\nShield Crush\nShield: Rears up or leaps into the air and then slams its shield down, creating a large shockwave. It will always use this once it hits 60% health to signal the beginning of Phase 2\nRun away and roll as you see the shield descending to avoid the attack. The area of effect is much larger than it looks and deals a massive amount of damage if it connects, so it's wise to roll even if it looks like you're far enough away. This attack does have a long recovery period, so if you're confident with your timing you can also roll in and land a few attacks while it recovers\n\n: Attack can be parried\nElden Ring Tree Sentinel Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nResembles Gyoubu Oniwa from Sekiro, another game made by From. It uses most of his attacks, minus his spear throw and spinning attack.\n\nTree Sentinel (Shield) Combo Chart\n\n Tree Sentinel  Limgrave  \n\nDrops\n3,200 (NG) 300 (Co-op)Golden Halberd \n\nHP\n2,889\n\nElden Ring Tree Sentinel Boss (Limgrave)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: The First Step\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nTree Sentinel Location\nThe Tree Sentinel is directly northeast from The First Step Site of Grace, and is usually visible immediately upon exiting the elevator up from the tutorial area.
