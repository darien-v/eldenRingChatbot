Azur's Glintstone Staff scales primarily with Intelligence and is a good Weapon for spellcasters that rely on their magic attacks.\n\nStaff of the primeval glintstone sorcerer Azur. Only those who have glimpsed what lies beyond the wisdom of stone may wield it.\nReduces casting time of all sorceries, but consumes additional FP. \n\nWhere to Find Azur's Glintstone Staff in Elden Ring\nAzur's Glintstone Staff can be found at the following location:\n\nLocation: Raya Lucaria Academy [Elden Ring Map here]\nAssuming you have unlocked all the shortcuts, specifically the ladder on the second floor of the Church of the Cuckoo site, fast travel to the said site and climb up the ladder. Be alert here since the upper level is guarded by a Glintstone Sorcerer and two Lazuli Sorcerers. Head towards the east side and you'll see an arch doorway at the end.\nDefeat the High Page guarding the entrance on the other side of the runway, you'll find the weapon on the ground, next to the crystal formation with the inactive School of Graven Mages in it at the center of the room.\nVideo Location\n\nElden Ring Azur's Glintstone Staff Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: No Skill\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War nor enchanted with Magic.\nAzur's Glintstone Staff can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nGives 40 virtual dexterity towards sorceries and incantations, making it slightly more effective than the Radagon Icon. Casting speed is capped at 70 dexterity.\nIncreases casting speed of sorceries and incantations by 10%. However, each spell and incantation is affected by casting-speed increases by a different amount due to differences in casting animations, so roughly 8-9% is a better estimate on average.\nIncreases FP cost of only sorceries by 20%, rounded down.\nThe increased casting speed does not work for Dragon Communion Incantations and Scarlet Rot.\nBonus casting speed applies to spells cast from staves or seals in the other hand. Does not require attribute requirements to be met in order for the bonus to apply.\nIn PvP, being able to attack before your opponent does is a big advantage. This staff helps caster builds be faster and compete with very fast melee weapons.\nIn PvE, a shorter cast time will make you able to take on faster, deadlier enemies who might've interrupted your big damage spells otherwise, although in the long run it might make your spells less FP efficent.\nWhile Azur's Staff does not provide any specific advantages for his personal school of spells (Glintstone Cometshard, Comet, and Comet Azur), most of those spells are high damage, single projectile spells, and it would be easier to maximize DPS by increasing the total number of spells cast (by increasing cast speed) than by simply increasing raw damage of each individual cast (See also, Lusat's Glintstone Staff) \n\nComet Azur is a bit of an outlier to this assessment, but due to the spells absurd damage output, the biggest limiting factor is whether or not you can complete the initial cast, and not the damage output of the spell itself, and therefore still benefits from this staff's increased casting speed\nWearing Azur's Glintstone Crown will even further enhance this small niche of glintstone sorceries\n\nSell Value:   500\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

The Int of the the character with the staff equipped at the time of posting the Sor Scaling is located in the (Int) to the right of the scaling amount. This will help to give a general idea of what staves are better at various Int levels until MAX is achieved.\nThis upgrade can be enchanted with Magic or boosted with Consumables.
