Godfrey was Queen Marika's first consort, and thus the first Elden Lord of the Lands Between. Before earning this title, he was known as Hoarah Loux, the chieftain of the badlands and a bloodthirsty warrior. Godfrey took the Beast Regent Serosh upon his back after committing to his role as a Lord in order to suppress his violent urges. After fighting countless wars, Marika deprived him and his warriors of their grace, marking them as the first Tarnished.\nThis is not an optional boss, as players must defeat it to advance in Elden Ring.\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade) is another variant of this boss.\n\nElden Ring Godfrey, First Elden Lord Boss\n\nThis is not an optional boss\nThis boss fight has two phases with different stats and names. After dealing 60% damage to Godfrey, First Elden Lord, a cutscene will play and he'll transform into Hoarah Loux, Warrior.\nClosest Site of Grace: Queen's Bedchamber\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: NPC Nepheli Loux and Shabriri can be summoned for this fight.

He will otherwise dash towards you and Stomp, covering the entire area in AoE.\nIn phase 2, recognize his grapple patterns.\nMost stomp attacks which cause a shockwave attack are more easily jumped over, than rolled through \n\nAlternatively, skills/spells that keeps player above ground can be used to avoid damage and inflict it at the same time.\n\nHis roar buffs and successful grab moves are slow, what player can use to cast Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike at point-blank for massive damage.\n\nGeneral Strategy\nAs one of the easier late game bosses, Godfrey is not an overly complicated fight. He hits extremely hard, but is relatively slow and telegraphs his moves way ahead of time. Given you have enough stamina, you can block most of his axe swings in phase 1, although dodging them should be your priority. \nMost of his stomp moves can be avoided simply by jumping as soon as you see him lower his leg.The regular stomp travels in a cone in front of him, leaving him briefly vulnerable to attacks. Avoid being caught on the wider side of the cone.\nGodfrey can empower his stomps. He will stand at a distance and raise his axe overhead, slowly lifting his legs. He will have a red aura while the effect lasts. Until it dissipates, the shockwaves from his stomp attacks will cover the entire arena.\nOnce Godfrey is brought down to about 50% HP, a cutscene will play where he sheds his armor, slays his regent Serosh, and unveils his true form as Hoarah Loux, Warrior.\nAs Hoarah Loux, Godfrey ditches his axe in favor of hand-to-hand grappling. The key to beating him is recognizing the patterns for his grapple moves and dodging them accordingly, as they might one-hit players with low Vigor and will go through a shield block.  The best openings to damage him are after he ends an attack chain, as well as after a leap attacks.Thankfully, emerging as Hoarah Loux does not refill his health bar, so you only have to deal with the final half.\nMelee Users\nStrategy Writeup for Melee Users\nMagic and Ranged Users\nAt the beginning of the fight, Godfrey will approach the player calmly, leaving you ample time to stage your opening move. Inflicting Frostbite is a good call, since his overall resistance are low, especially during 2nd part of the fight\nSorcery users can start the fight with Terra Magica, followed by Rennala's Full Moon. Comet Azur can be risky, as Godfrey might open with a jump attack if the player isn't in range. Speed is more important than damage here, especially in phase 2, so good choices would be Comet/Glintstone Cometshard or Glintstone Icecrag.\nAs for Incantations, you can start the first phase with Borealis's Mist. This will provoke the First Elden Lord to perform an attack, often a stomp, but you should be safe during casting the incantation. It might be worth trying the same in the second phase, although Hoarah Loux's attack patterns makes this risky. During the second half of each phase, a fast spell like Lightning Spear is the best choice to chip away his health. Roar buffs can be used to approach him carefully, then cast charged Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike for maximum damage.\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord Attacks & Counters\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nAxe Toss\nLeaps upwards, tossing his axe a short distance forward before quickly chasing after it.\nRun towards and under him to avoid the axe and subsequent slam, or dodge.\n\nPlunging Axe\nLeaps upwards, then plunges the haft of his axe into the ground.\nDodge as he lands on the ground.\n\nTriple Axe Combo\nSwings to his right, then to his left, following up with a final slash to the left.\nDodge towards the direction each attack is coming from.\n\nOverhead Smash\nPerforms a quick overhead smash with his axe, often followed by other moves, most commonly a 360° spin and a subsequent second overhead smash.\nDodge to the side.\n\nFissure\nBriefly whirls his axe above his head before crashing it into the ground, pushing it down further after a brief delay. This creates a narrow fissure that spans the whole length of the arena. The released energy burst deals immense damage.\nMove out of the fissure immediately (to the side).\n\nStomp\nRaises one leg for a powerful stomp, sending a shockwave that causes a cone of rocks to burst from the ground in front of him. Often combos this with other moves.\nJump as his foot lands or dodge the narrowest part of the cone at melee range.\n\nRegal Roar\nRaises his axe overhead with both hands, lifting right leg, charging up with a red aura. Then stomps the ground, releasing a shockwave spanning almost the entire arena in all directions. As long as his aura is active, all his stomps will have an arena-wide radius.\nJump as his foot lands. Avoid follow-up combos with additional jumps. Or, get in as much damage as you can, then dodge at the last minute.\n\nHoarah Loux\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nEarth Shattering Stomp\n Just as in phase 1, but additionally, he's smashing the ground with both hands, sending two shockwaves consecutively. \nJump as his leg hits the ground, then avoid follow-up combos with additional jumps.\n\nPower Bomb\nRuns towards his target with his arms swinging high, attempting to grab them. If the attack connects, they are tossed into the air and Hoarah Loux leaps after them, slamming them back down for immense damage. He will sometimes perform a running leap to start off the move, which will be much faster than his regular running animation.\nTime your dodge well and dodge to the side.\n\nRunning Power Bomb\nDashes towards his target with his arms crossed above his chest, performing a claw strike. If the attack connects, they are sent flying diagonally up and forward, after which Hoarah Loux leaps after them to slam them to the ground.\nCan be dodged just like Power Bomb, of which this is an alternate version with slightly higher damage.\n\nHoarah Loux's Earthshaker\n A three-step move: First a roar that knocks targets down if it connects, directly followed by a leap. Upon impact, he slams his fist into the ground, creating a large shockwave. Finally, he plunges both arms into the ground, pulling them back out after a short delay. This causes energy to erupt from the ground in several places.After Hoarah's Loux rage, 2nd part and 3rd part releases a shockwave.  \n Maintain distance during roar, time a dodge for the slam. As he is plunging his arms into the ground, clear the area of eruption. When in safe zone, a long-range attack can be performed with ease.Note: Can be poise broken between 2nd and 3rd part of the attack, but this not cancel it. \n\nKick\nA powerful kick upwards that knocks players down.\nCan easily be sidestepped or dodged due to its narrow hitbox.\n\nChoke Slam\nWinds up his right arm, then after a short delay attempts to grab his target. If the grab connects, he lifts them overhead with one hand and slams them back down.\nDodge backwards or to the side to avoid the grab. This attack is often used after he knocked the player down with his kick, while they are immune to be grabbed.\n\nClaw Barrage\nPerforms two quick swipes with his claws, followed by a delayed uppercut with his left. He will sometimes follow this up with a Choke Slam.\nBlock; or dodge in the direction each attack comes from.\n\nLeg sweep\nLow position leg sweep, performed mainly after other leg attacks\nJump or back away\n\nHoarah Loux's Rage\n After lowering health to about 20% of max HP, Hoarah enters a rage mode in which he at start shouts with his right leg up and then attacks the ground 2 times. Each attack unleashes a shockwave, that covers whole area (like Regal Roar). \nJump to avoid shockwave. Or, get in as much damage as you can, then dodge at the last moment.\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nAt the beginning of the fight, Godfrey is seen cradling the corpse of his son Morgott, slowly dissipating into golden dust. His other sons are Mohg and Godwyn.\nSerosh is seen biting into Godfrey’s shoulder during the fight. This is synonymous with him acting as a sort of limiter for his true nature.\nPlayer will be teleported to the center of the arena for phase 2 only if they don't finish the first phase with a critical strike.\nLore suggests that the powerful warrior Hoarah Loux was chosen by Queen Marika as her consort, making him the First Elden Lord. Due to this, he took the Beast Regent Serosh upon his back, taming his bloodthirsty and wild nature, and taking on the name of Godfrey. After winning many wars for the Erdtree, he was robbed of his grace, and was banished from the Lands Between, becoming the first Tarnished. \nHis Golden Shade variant has a two-headed axe, while Godfrey only has half of the axe head left.\nSerosh has two model meshes, with the brighter one being used for cutscenes. The mesh's name referred to as “Marikesu,” likely related to Maliketh.\nDuring 1st phase, Godfrey is immune to debuff caused by Blade of Death and Destined Death - skills saps his HP, but does not reduce his max HP. This is a very rare immunity in Elden Ring and it is unknown, whenever it is either a glitch or there is a lore explanation.\nIf Godfrey's stance is broken by the hit that triggers phase transition, nothing will happen and it will regenerate\nBug: If Tarnished is grabbed during an action like casting a spell, it's model may act in a weird way. \nDuring first phase there is Hoarah Loux model under boss fight arena.\nIn 1.00, both 1st and 2nd phases has separate healthbars. \nHoarah Loux's Earthshaker attack lacks veins on the ground in 1.00 version of the game.\n\nDialogue\nIntroduction:\nIt's been a long while, Morgott.Long and hard didst thou fight.Tarnished Warrior.Spurned by the grace of gold.Be assured, the Elden Ringresteth close at hand.Alas, I am returned.To be granted audience once more.Upon my name as Godfrey, The first Elden Lord!\nDuring Fight:\n(Halfway)That will be all.Thou didst me good service, Serosh.I've Given thee courtesy enough.Rrraaargh!Now I fight as Hoarah Loux!Warrior!\n(Defeating player in Phase 1)Tarnished Warrior. 'Twas nobly fought.(1.00) Thy rest is well deserved.\n(Defeating player in Phase 2)A crown is warranted with strength!(After Fight)Brave Tarnished...Thy strength befits a crown. (1.00) <laughs>\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord Image Gallery \n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
