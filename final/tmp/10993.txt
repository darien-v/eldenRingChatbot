CONTEXT
\nSorceries are a type of Magic in Elden Ring. Sorcery Spells are often dependent on the Intelligence stat, and have a variety of effects, from conjuring magic projectiles, to calling down meteors, and even attacking using blood magic. (There are also a few spells with effects other than dealing damage.) Sorceries are cast using a Glintstone Staff. There are trainers that allow you to purchase many spells for Runes, while others are found in the world.\nYou can hold the cast button to charge some Sorceries, to release a more powerful version, without consuming more resources. This will delay casting time; but there are several Staffs, Talismans, and other pieces of Equipment that can assist with cast time and FP consumption.\nNote that casting a spell also consumes Stamina, so it may be useful to invest some points into Endurance. See Builds for ideas on how to optimize your character.\n\nSorcery Trainers\nMost Sorceries can be acquired from different NPCs that act as trainers and sell you Sorcery Spells. Here is a list with all Sorcery Trainers in Elden Ring:\n\nThops is inside the Church of Irith in Liurnia of the Lakes.\nSorceress Sellen can be found standing by a treasure chest within the Waypoint Ruins in the eastern part of West Limgrave.\nGowry sits in Gowry's Shack, south of Sellia, Town of Sorcery. He becomes a merchant after the player retrieves the Unalloyed Gold Needle for the Millicent quest.\nMiriel, Pastor of Vows is inside the Church of Vows.\nPreceptor Seluvis can be found in Seluvis's Rise, after meeting him in spectral form in Ranni's Rise.\n\nOf these trainers, a select few have the ability to learn from Scrolls and grant access to new Sorceries:\n\nMiriel, Paster of Vows is a highly recommended choice, because he does not move from his position at the Church of Vows, and you may give him both Sorcery scrolls and Incantation Prayerbooks. \nSorceress Sellen\nPreceptor Seluvis\n\nLegendary Sorcery Spells in Elden Ring\nTo unlock the Legendary Sorceries and Incantations Trophy and Achievement you will need to acquire the following sorceries:\n\nFounding Rain of Stars\nRanni's Dark Moon\nComet Azur\nStars of Ruin\n\nSorceries\n\nIncantations\n\nElden Ring Sorceries\nSorceries Scrolls\n\n Name \n Unlocks \n Location \n\n Academy Scroll \n\nGreat Glintstone Shard\nSwift Glintstone Shard\n\n Found in the graveyard just by the starting Site of Grace of Liurnia of the Lakes, Lake-Facing Cliffs.

QUESTION
Why might one select a specific sorcery trainer in Elden Ring to learn new sorceries?

ANSWER
One might select a specific sorcery trainer, such as Miriel or Sorceress Sellen, in Elden Ring to learn new sorceries because they offer the ability to learn from Scrolls and grant access to new sorceries.
