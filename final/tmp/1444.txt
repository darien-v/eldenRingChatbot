This powerful Omen has royal blood and communes with an outer god known as the Mother of Truth. This is an optional boss as players do not need to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring, but either it or the Valiant Gargoyle duo must be defeated to enter Deeproot Depths and achieve a certain ending. \nMohg, Lord of Blood is another variant of this boss. In the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Mohg, Lord of Blood plays a crucial role. He is responsible for kidnapping Miquella, the central character of the DLC, and attempting to use him in a failed deification ritual. Mohg's actions directly influence the storyline and themes of the DLC, as they lead to Miquella being trapped in a cocoon within the Haligtree.\n\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Gameplay\n\nShadow of the Erdtree Release Date Trailer Impressions\n\nThe reigning lord and hierarch of the coming dynasty of Mohgwyn.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 means the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it.

When he is close and about to strike, use the Mohg's shackle item to interrupt him then unleash some charged attacks on him. You may need to trade a hit or two, but you should be able to stagger him with all of that time and get a critical strike. Feel free to run away and rebuff if needed, let your summon take aggro and dodge through his attacks. Land a charged attack while he is busy with your summon then immediately use the Mohg's Shackle again--note that you can only use it TWICE each time you fight him. Then land some heavy or charged attacks afterward. It should be easy to stagger him at this point and now you get to face him with substantially less health. From here on just read his attacks and throw out some light attacks in between or run and gun if you would like to (the pillars can stop his bloodsplatter ability if they aren't knocked down yet). It might be tricky to get down but with the hammer talisman and the flask of wondrous physick that buffs charged attacks+stance break, I was able to break his stance with a straight sword, one-handed.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor magic and ranged users, you need to be careful when casting spells/incantations or using ranged skills, his trident has a long reach and can clip you where you think you might not get hit. He also has a couple of bloodflame spells that can be used as projectiles. Try casting spells/incantations that are quick or heavy-hitting and make sure you're either at a safe distance, or when he's casting a spell as well, but do not trade blows with him when he's casting a spell as it is not worth it. Only do so if you think you're safe, you can take advantage of the pillars from the area to hide from the projectile. If you're using a bow and arrow, you can safely jump and shoot from a safe distance while kiting him around the area. You can also use Mohg's Shackle then cast the spell/incantation of your choice, note that you can only use the shackle twice each time you fight him.\nAlternatively, prepare your Flask of Wondrous Physick with the Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear and Cerulean Hidden Tear (to boost your magic dmg and make spells cost no FP), cast Terra Magica just before entering the fog gate (this way, the circle extends into the boss room), drink the Wondrous Physick outside, then as soon as you enter, start casting Comet Azur. You don't even have to move forward, as the laser is long enough to reach him from where you enter the boss room. If Mohg starts to do his chanting first, you'll begin firing right as he finishes his chant. It has a bit of an RNG to it as to what he decides to do and can one-shot you if he stops to throw blood, but if he just slowly walks toward you, he'll be dead within seconds, even with his 47% magic absorb. Since he is one of the bosses who don't dodge out of harm's way, this is a fully working strategy here.\n\nMohg, the Omen Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nTrident thrust attack\nHe will Thrust his trident in your direction (possibly can be triggered when you heal haven't tested theory)\nGet out of reach, block, or dodge\n\nBloodboon\nMohg will reach into the air and then toss a splash of bloodflame. This can come in a wide arc, narrow cone, or in a shower at his position. The floor where this attack contacts will light in bloodflame, dealing fire damage and contributing to hemorrhage buildup.\n\nThe wide arc variant is used at medium range and can be evaded by rolling forward.\nRoll to the side to avoid the cone variant.\nGet behind him to punish the shower variant.\n\nTrident combos\n He has a triple swing combo, a swing then ground stab combo, and a swing + overhead slam combo \nWatch his trident. The moment it moves dodge through the swipe and prepare to dodge the next 1-2 swings until he does a heavier attack and stops. When he stabs the ground and you are knocked down--don't immediately get up, there is a hitbox when he pulls out the trident! You can watch the trident to see if he plans on attacking again right after or if he is going to use a spell instead.\n\nBloodlfame Talons\nMohg will slash the air near him with his left hand, before it explodes.\nThe slash itself is less harmful than the explosion. Roll away right before it detonates. Be careful if you're aggressively rolling forward into his trident attacks as he can use this attack to roll-catch you.\n\n  Mohg, the Omen Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\nMohg, the Omen is an optional boss encountered within the Cathedral of the Forsaken, located in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. This ancient site lies just down the stairs from the Forsaken Depths Site of Grace, serving as the lair for this malevolent entity. To confront this ominous adversary, players can opt for a multi-player approach, allowing them to summon Spirit Ashes to aid in battle. Alternatively, they can enlist the help of Dung Eater, an NPC who can be summoned if freed from his cell. Although vanquishing Elden Ring Mohg, the Omen is not mandatory for progression, it is a crucial step for unlocking a specific ending. Players should prepare themselves for a challenging encounter, as this boss is known for its fierce attacks and cunning tactics.\nWhen do you kill Mohg Elden Ring?\nThis is a frequently asked question that could be referring to either the Mohg, Lord of Blood or Mohg, the Omen. Both bosses are optional so there is not a specific time that you will need to kill either of them. This Mohg the Omen is not optional for at least one of the Endings in the game, but is overall still an optional Bosses and does not need to be completed to progress through the other Endings in th game. He and can be encountered in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds in Leyndell, Royal Capital. This area is accessible by descending the stairs at the Avenue Balcony Site of Grace and immediately turning left out of the double grate doors. First walk to the railing, and then move northwest until the rooftops are directly to your left. Hop over the railing onto the rooftops, then descend into the plaza. From the plaza's center, face due North. The well's wooden structure will be visible between a dilapidated ruin and the walkway.\nAs you make your way through this Location, make sure you pick up Mohg’s Shackle  which can greatly help against your upcoming Boss encounter. It will be guarded by 2 Giant Crayfish. View the Video location for visual guidance on this item's location. As you get through this area, you may encounter the Dung Eater and eventually you will find your way to the Cathedral of the Forsaken. Once you activate the Forsaken Depths Site of Grace  and directly ahead is Mohg's room where you can get a chance to face him. \nMohg, the Omen Lore, Notes\n\nVoice Actor: Con O'Neill\nUnlike Mohg, Lord of the Blood, this boss is an illusion. This is indicated by a soundtrack called "Omen Illusion". It was probably created by Morgott to protect altair there. \n\nAdditionally, this boss has only one death animation despite being ripostable At one point he received an update and his death animation when riposted is different.\n\nAfter the boss fight, loot the treasure chest, then activate the Site of Grace: Cathedral of The Forsaken. Stand behind the treasure chest and (with your back to the chest and you're facing an altar/ wall) attack the altar/ wall. A secret pathway will open up. \n\nThere will be a blockade active as long as Morgott, The Omen King isalive\n\nMohg, the Omen Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
