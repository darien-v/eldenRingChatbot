CONTEXT
\nStatus Effects in Elden Ring covers information regarding the different status effects that are obtained by both players and NPCs. Status Effects can be equally devastating to the player, Bosses, and other Enemies of the Lands Between. This page contains a full list of all the Status Effects in the game.\nThe efficacy of inflicting Status Effects is greater against unaware Enemies. \n\nSee Buffs & Debuffs for useful information regarding the stacking or overwriting of effects on your character.\nSee Equipment with Special Effects for special stat-increasing or effect-granting weapons and armor.\nSee Damage Types to identify the best sources and resistances for all damage types.\nSee Affinities for a comparison of each affinity's effects and their respective whetblades.\n\nElden Ring Status Effects\n\nPoison\nToxins designed to whittle and slowly sap the life from enemies can inflict Poison or Deadly Poison.\nWhen inflicted by Poison, the victim suffers from damage-over-time. The exact damage and duration varies with source of Poison.\n\nScarlet Rot\nPathogens designed to crumble the very being of its enemies and consume their flesh can inflict Scarlet Rot.\nWhen inflicted by Scarlet Rot, the victim suffers from considerable damage-over-time. The exact damage and duration varies with source of Rot.\n\nBlood Loss\nTechniques designed to wound and exsanguinate can inflict acute Blood Loss.\nWhen inflicted by Blood Loss, the victim suffers instant damage based on their max HP (100 + 15%, or 200 + 15%).\n\nFrostbite\nCold and Freezing techniques can inflict Frostbite.\nWhen inflicted by Frostbite, the victim suffers HP damage (30 + 10%), damage negation penalty to all sources (-20%), and slowed Stamina recovery speed. The debuff lasts 30 seconds, but can be cured prematurely by receiving Fire damage.\n\nSleep\nTranquilizing agents hailing from St. Trina and its lilies can inflict its targets with drowsiness, forcing them to Sleep.\nWhen inflicted by Sleep, the victim falls asleep or briefly loses their balance. This effect can also cure mind control, see Giant Ant.\n\nMadness\nContagious mental illness hailing from the Three Fingers and the Flame of Frenzy can inflict Madness.\nWhen consumed by Madness, the victim is briefly stunned and suffers damage based on max HP (100 + 15%) and FP (30 + 10%).\n\nDeath Blight\nCorrupted influence extracted from the Rune of Death can inflict Death Blight.\nWhen taken by Death Blight, spires of pure death rapidly grow from their dead body, killing the victim immediately. \n\nElden Ring Character Effects Icons\nA list of icons displayed under your healthbar indicates current statuses from afflictions, but also beneficial ones from allies, Incantations, Talismans or Equipment with Special Effects. A list of icons and their meaning is provided below:\n\nIcons with square borders represent permanent effects or effects which come from a permanent source such as a Talisman. \n\nPermanent afflictions can be freely stacked together.\n\nIcons with diamond borders represent temporary effects. \n\nTemporary afflictions, such as buffs/debuffs, are often categorized and only one of each category can be active at a time.\n\nIcons with no border represent effects which seem to be reactive with the world or have contextual requirements, but are not as clearly defined as those aforementioned.\n\nGeneral Status Effects\n\nQuick Search of All General Status Effects\n\nIcon\nEffect\nItem/Action Granting Effect\n\nIncreases Max HP\nIncreases Vigor\n\nCrimson Amber

QUESTION
What are the different status effects and their effects in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
The different status effects in Elden Ring are Poison, Scarlet Rot, Blood Loss, Frostbite, Sleep, Madness, and Death Blight. Poison inflicts damage over time, Scarlet Rot causes considerable damage over time, Blood Loss inflicts immediate damage based on max HP, Frostbite lowers HP, stamina recovery speed, and damage negation, Sleep forces the victim to fall asleep, Madness briefly stuns and inflicts damage based on max HP and FP, and Death Blight kills the victim immediately by growing spires of pure death from their body.
