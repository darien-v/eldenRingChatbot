The Frozen Needle scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for inflicting frost on enemies. \n\nA razor-thin piercing blade of ice.Forged by Ijii, the carian Royal Blackmith.\nCan inflict frost upon enemies, and launch its blade with a strong attack.  The blade immediately regenerates. \n\nWhere to Find Frozen Needle in Elden Ring\nThe Frozen Needle weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nKingsrealm Ruins: Found in a chest inside a small room at the end of the underground area in the northeast. Requires defeating of the Royal Revenant boss in order to access the room.

Charged heavy attacks give the projectile increased damage and range. The projectile is not affected by Axe Talisman.\nThe feint attack (tap dodge while holding R2) will also shoot out a projectile, and is a very useful tool for spacing and makes up for the short range of the projectile by moving your character backwards. \nDue to the unique nature of the Thrusting Sword powerstance moveset, this weapon makes a very good right hand weapon for dual-wielders \n\nBecause of the unique nature of this weapons R2 move, it remains a very viable option even when using two weapons (Typically R2 becomes overshadowed by the higher damage L1s)\nFrozen Needle's biggest weakness is its low overall damage, so powerstancing can help reduce that deficiency \nThe 2nd L1 in the thrusting sword powerstance combo is comprised of a triple hit from the right hand weapon ONLY, which will allow you to proc Frost on enemies faster.  This also works as the second L1 out of a roll or backstep. \n\nIn addition, you can buff your left hand weapon with fire, making it possible to instantly reset frost and allow you to apply it again just as quickly\nThe left hand thrusting sword is typically used for wide slashing attacks, so it makes most sense to leverage a longer tool for your left sword.  Estoc or Cleanrot Knight's Sword make for good option.\n\nThis can give you an extremely wide variety of tools to deal with enemies and make for a fun high-skill weapon set that doesn't rely on strong weapon arts\n\nCauses Frost buildup:  (60)\n\nNOTE: Frost buildup does not increase with upgrade level\n\nSell Value:   200\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, the speed of Thrusting Swords' crouching attacks has been reduced. Poise damage has also been reduced, but only for PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
