CONTEXT
\n\n Godskin Swaddling Cloth \n\nWeight\n0.9\n\nEffect \n\n Successive attacks restore 30 + 3% \n       HP\n\nGodskin Swaddling Cloth is a Talisman in Elden Ring. Godskin Swaddling Cloth causes successive attacks to restore HP. Players can use talismans in Elden Ring to boost a variety of Stats.\n\nSacred cloth of the Godskin Apostles, made from supple skin sewn together.\nSuccessive attacks restore HP.\nThe Gloam-Eyed Queen cradles newborn apostles swaddled in this cloth. Soon they will grow to become the death of the gods.\n\nGodskin Swaddling Cloth Effect in Elden Ring\nGodskin Swaddling Cloth causes successive attacks to restore HP.\n\nWorks only for consecutive melee-type attacks. \n\nSome very specific melee-like spells, like Carian Slicer, can trigger the talisman's effect. However, they require a more significant amount of hits to trigger the effect.\n\nHeal is 3% plus a flat 30. At 1450 maximum HP (40 Vigor), it heals for 73 HP (43 + 30). At 1900 maximum HP (60 Vigor), it heals 87 HP (57 + 30).\nProc buildup depends on various factors, such as; weapon type, type of attack, and Ashes of War (melee-type only). Damage dealt does not affect progress. Two-handing a weapon doesn't influence a proc's buildup, unless the alternate moveset changes the amount of hits per attack.\nIf using light attacks:\n\nFists / Claws / Daggers / Torches / Sacred Seals / Small Shields take 7 hits to activate the talisman. \nAll other weapons not listed above will activate the talisman's effect in 5 hits. \n\nNotes to consider: \n\nLightning Ram proved to reduce the hit count on a Caestus from 7 hits to 4. There was no difference on varying upgrade levels.\nCharge Forth Ash of War in Golem's Halberd, despite having multiple hits during the charge, does not trigger the talisman. This seemed consistent to the same Ash of War applied to other weapons.\n\nHeavy attacks behave differently: \n\nCharged attacks make the talisman's effect trigger on the third hit, but any other variations of heavy attacks (such as jumping, standing, or crouching) need 4 hits to trigger the effect.\nThis makes weapons with multiple hits on heavy attack (such as Twinblades' two-handed charged attack) a more favorable option when using this talisman.\n\nSpecial Cases: \n\nA charged Shield Crash can causes swaddle to proc multiple times. \n\nThe effect can occur so fast that the additional health will occur seconds after the proc.\n\nThe player does not need to hit the same target for the effect to trigger, but all targets that have been hit are counted towards the total hits needed for triggering the effect.\nBased on extensive in-game testing, there's a possibility that the talisman has a meter that fills up varying amounts. These amounts depend on the type of hit, in relation to weapon type. \n\nIf the user stops attacking, said meter would slowly regress back to 0 over time.\n\nGodskin Swaddling Cloth Location in Elden Ring\nSpiritcaller Cave: Dropped by the Spirit-Caller Snail that summons the Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble in a consecutive boss encounter.
