The One-Eyed Shield is a Shield that scales primarily with Strength. Greatshields weigh a decent amount and provide the best protection in the game. Greatshields provide a greater value of blocking and protecting one's self from enemy and boss attacks, but greatly increases the weight and reduces the player's mobility. This type of shield works best at reducing damage or guarding instead of parrying.\n\nTricksome shield made from white stone depicting a malformed one-eyed god.

QUESTION
Why does the Flame Spit damage from the One-Eyed Shield not scale with Strength but increase with the shield's upgrade level?

ANSWER
Flame Spit damage from the One-Eyed Shield does not scale with Strength but increases with the shield's upgrade level because it follows a different scaling mechanic based on upgrade level.
