He was previously married to Rennala, but became Queen Marika's consort after Godfrey was exiled from the Lands Between. Completing Brother Corhyn & Goldmask's quest to a certain point reveals that he is the "other half" of Queen Marika. Despite being of one body, the two do not share the same will, as evident from Radagon attempting to repair the Elden Ring after Marika had shattered it.\nThis boss is NOT optional as players must defeat him to reach the end of Elden Ring. As with many endgame bosses, Weapons, Incantations, and Spirit Ashes capable of inflicting Black Flame are highly recommended as they deal damage over time based on the boss' maximum HP. Be aware that depleting his health completely immediately takes you into the cutscene leading to the final boss fight - Elden Beast. If you die to the Elden Beast, you are required to fight Radagon again before reaching it.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Shardbearers drop their own unique Great Rune and Remembrance capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, Ashes of War, and Talismans for the player.\n\n As the husband of Rennala of Caria, the red-haired Radagon studied sorcery, and as the husband of Queen Marika, he studied incantations.\nThus did the hero aspire to be complete.\n\nRadagon of the Golden Order\nRadagon of the Golden Order is a God Boss found in the Stone Platform.\n\nThis boss is NOT optional.\nThis is a God boss.\nClosest Site of Grace: The Elden Throne\nIs multiplayer allowed for this boss? Yes\nSpirit ashes can be summoned for this boss.\n\nElden Ring Radagon of the Golden Order Location\nRadagon of the Golden Order can be found by entering the glowing wall after defeating Hoarah Loux, Warrior.\n\nRadagon of the Golden Order Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG (13339), NG+ (13353), NG++ (14688), NG+3 (15356), NG+4 (16023), NG+5 (17359), NG+6 (18026), NG+7 (18694)\nDefense: ???\nStance: 120\nParryable: Yes, but 3 parries are required per stance break\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being stance broken or parried\nDamage:  Standard, Strike, Holy\nAble to parry attack and retaliate range attacks, throwable items and spells (excluding Night Sorceries/Lightning Spear and those that does not directly target him like Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike)\n\nOnly specfic range attack can activate his parry stance, but with it he can deflect melee attack - excluding jumping attacks and whips - as well\nWhile in parry stance, he will deflect all directly aimed spells, even if they don't activate his parry stance. \n\n Upon defeat, a cutscene will play and the fight against the Elden Beast will begin.\n\nAbsorptions\n\nPhy (Standard): 35\nPhy (Slash): 35\nPhy (Strike): 10\nPhy (Pierce): 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 0\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 80\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if an absorption is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 627.4\nScarlet Rot: 627.4\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: 627.4\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\nDeath Blight: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Radagon of the Golden Order Boss Guide\n\nRadagon of the Golden Order Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nRadagon of the Golden Order Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Radagon of the Golden Order:\n\nUse the Black Knife Tiche Ash Summons\nUse Lord's Divine Fortification to greatly reduce the damage of Radagon's holy attacks. Alternatively, Divine Fortification, Haligdrake Talisman (+2, does stack with spells) or Holyproof Dried Liver help to a lesser degree. \n\n60-70% damage negation should make most attacks survivable with 40 VIG.\nFocus on holy damage negation more than physical, since his melee attacks are easier to avoid.\n\nParticularly affected by offensive Godskin Incanatations, therefore Black Flame Blade, or other offensive Godskin incantations. He has 0 resistance to fire-based attacks and Black Flame incantations deal additional percentage-based damage over time.\nFire weapons are advisable, Magma Blade and the Blasphemous Blade are strong choices. With both weapon arts dealing high fire damage.\n\nMelee Users\nAt the beginning of the fight, you can run toward him and safely make an attack or two (depending on weapon speed).\nRadagon is vulnerable to stance damage. If you're consistent about applying it, then he can be stance-broken 3 times in this fight, giving you a much-needed break to reapply buffs, drink flasks, or stack more damage. Heavy thrusting swords like Dragon King's Cragblade can guard counter quickly, which is useful since taking advantage of his openings is much more difficult with slower weapons like Bloodhound's Fang. Most of his moves have long recovery time, which will let you get in a jumping heavy attack or charged attack.\nUse Godskin magics, like Black Flame Blade. As stated in the Godskin Prayerbook, Godskin incantations were created to kill Gods such as Radagon.\nThe biggest melee threat in Radagon's arsenal is his grab. When his arm starts glowing, he starts readying a lunge grab, which has limited tracking and a generous hitbox. In testing, this move killed from full health at 50 Vigor, using Lionel's Set and damage reduction talismans. His grab has a medium lunge that can be outrun. Begin sprinting away as he starts his grab, and it will never hit you. Alternatively, his grab can be reliably dodged by rolling into him.\nRecommended talismans for melee users: Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Haligdrake Talisman, Green Turtle Talisman. This combo will let you tank a few of his hits with as little chip damage as possible. He'll often hit you even if you roll past him, thanks to his backswing, so it's important to keep as much health and stamina as possible to follow up on his openings. The Crimson Seed Talisman will stretch each flask further in this marathon of a final boss.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nAt the beginning of the fight, you can hit him with two fast- or medium-casting spells (although sometimes he parries the second), or one slow-casting spell.\nWhen fighting Radagon at range, there are two major threats - maybe three. The first is his big ground slam. This is easily identified by him leaping into the air and hovering for a bit. Reflexes say dodge when this hits the ground but that is the last thing you want to do. It's not so much a typical AoE attack as it is a nova. So, the attack spreads out. You want to dodge after he hits. It might take a try or two to get this one figured out. The second major one is when he charges up his hammer and slams it three times in a row for big fan-shaped explosions. Much like the first, this one has some deceptiveness built in. It is not a 100% fan that hits everywhere it lights up. It actually fires out several trails, one of which goes right towards you. This becomes super easy to dodge once you realize this because all you need to do is dodge backward (or forward) at 45-60 degree angle and he'll miss with all of them.\nOne note about the first slam is that it might feel like a good time to get in some damage, and it is, but don't get caught with your pants down and in a big animation. Even if he looks like he might attack a spirit or friend, he has a tendency to change targets while up in the air and gives little warning!\nThe third major thing to watch out for is his lightning bolt. However, this one doesn't have much in the way of trickery, but getting the timing down might take a try or two. \nOnce you can reliably avoid these three things the rest of it is pretty easy in terms of defense. The biggest trouble is finding the time to get the hits in. Something with a quick animation is your friend, but he is also prone to losing/switching aggro so you can hit him with something big here and there. He also seems to maintain a fairly steady tempo, so his wind-up/wind-down/recovery between attacks feels consistent and can help you get an idea for when to attack. \nAs for what he is weak to? Good question! Testing would be required, but he seems to take a lot of damage from most things. Glintstone Icecrag hits him really hard, and Stars of Ruin can do some work if you need a bit more range. Hitting him with Ranni's Dark Moon when he loses aggro can give you a little boost in damage going forward thanks to its magic resistance reduction. Quite frankly, he takes a lot of damage and could even be considered fairly squishy, but he has a tendency to take you out of the fight before you can capitulate - or he'll do enough damage to you that you go into the next round without as many resources as you may need. Note that Radagon will not use his ranged damage reducing move against night sorceries, making something like night comet good to bring along\nOne thing I did find is that Black Knife Tiche (bless her soul) is as good against him she is against most bosses. Her rot-blade or whatever nonsense she flings around can easily take 20% of his Hp by the time its DoT runs out, so she is a good one to use. She's also durable enough that she will last through both fights without issue. \nWith a little luck and some good timing, you can eliminate Radagon inside a minute, if not quicker, leaving you with just the follow-up fight to deal with. As a sorcerer, that one feels like a lot bigger threat!\nFor incantation users, Black Flame and Lightning Spear are both effective punishers. Radagon also seems to be vulnerable to the Frenzied Flame spells. Frenzied Burst is highly recommended due to it's long range. For the second phase against Elden Beast, Pest Threads (at close range) deals heavy damage to large targets such as the Beast.\n\nRadagon of the Golden Order Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nRadagon’sSpear\nRadagon leaps up and throws a large holy spear towards the player, which lingers before exploding.\nJump over or dodge to the side and keep distance from the bolt until it explodes\n\nHoly Spear Fan\nRadagon throws five small holy spears in front of him in a fan formation, which linger on the ground before exploding. He may also use this while airborne, and can repeat the attack multiple times.\nDodge forward through them.\n\n Grab\nRadagon's missing arm materializes with golden light, raising it before grabbing his target with a shockwave, before beginning to slam them with his hammer. The shockwave itself also deals damage.\nThe timing on this one is strange the attack lags and leaves you prone to panic rolling. Wait about two and a half seconds and then roll into Radagon.  \n\nParry Stance\nRadagon raises his left arm as sort of protection. In this state he will deflect range/melee attacks with 1-2 HP damage at max and retaliate, either with Holy Spear Fan or Grab,\nAvoid atacking, when parry stance is active.\n\nCharge Swing\nRadagon charges towards the player with their hammer held out to the right.\nDodge into Radagon.\n\nGold Breaker\nRadagon jumps into the air, hovers for a moment as his hammer glows, then lunges down towards the player, creating a explosion.\nDodge towards Radagon as he lunges down. This avoids the AOE pulse of the attack, making it much easier to avoid.\n\nElden Shattering\nThis attack occurs when Radagon is around 50% health. After teleporting to the center of the arena, Radagon imbues his hammer before slamming the ground three times, with each strike creating a larger shockwave that travels across the ground. The last strike creates the symbol of the Elden Ring on the ground.\nRun away or dodge into it.\n\nDraining Field\nRadagon manifests a holy spear and slams it down, creating a field that drains health when one stands in it.\nDodge and move away.\n\nImbued Hammer Slam\nRadagon imbues his hammer and slams it downward, creating a large shockwave. He often uses this during his combos\nDodge into it.\n\nImbued Hammer Wave\nRadagon imbues his hammer and swipes it across from him, creating a damaging wave that travels forward and explodes shortly afterward. Often used at the end of his many combos. He can use this attack while airborne.\nDodge to the sides.\n\nTeleport\nRadagon teleports away, creating a shockwave everytime he reappears, dealing minor damage\nThis is arguably the most irritating attack, as it can be chained quite often. Just dodge away from it.\n\nStomp\nLifts his foot up and slams it down quickly. Often used before or during one of his melee combos. He may also imbue this attack to create a large explosion of holy energy.\nRoll away, as this move is often followed up with another one of his attacks.\n\nRadagon Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nOriginally Radagon's lyrics were all in Latin, but the music production team decided to make them untranslatable just like in the other boss songs, as a result only few Latin words ended up in the official lyrics of the Final Battle theme. This was confirmed by Youtuber Antonius Tertius (aka redditor MAGISTER ORGANI) who contacted the singers and music producers of Elden Ring and published the lyrics and backstage information regarding the music production of the game on Youtube.\nThe Final Battle theme was originally named Marika, which suggests that the developers probably had sketched a Marika boss fight; this information also comes from Youtuber Antonius Tertius, the one who contacted the music producers and singers of Elden Ring.\nUpon using the Law of Regression incantation on a statue in Leyndell Royal Capital, a message will appear saying "Radagon is Marika," showing the connection between the two.\nThe description for Marika's Hammer says that Marika shattered the Elden Ring, while Radagon attempted to fix it, suggesting that the two halves are in conflict with each other.\nIn the introduction to Elden Ring the two halves are shown, Marika shattering the ring and Radagon attempting to repair it.\nAccording to Fromsoft player stats, Ragadon is the 4th most fought boss in Elden ring.
