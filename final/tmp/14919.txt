CONTEXT
\n\n D, Beholder of Death \n\nLocation\nNokron, Eternal City\n\nRole\nQuest NPC and Summon\n\nVoiced by\n ???\n\nD, Beholder of Death (real name: Devin) is an NPC in Elden Ring. He can be found in Nokron, Eternal City, east of the Great Waterfall Basin grace. To interact with D, Beholder of Death, you need the Twinned Armor. If given the armor, he will be available as a summon against the Valiant Gargoyle pair. He is the twin brother of Darian, also known as D, Hunter of the Dead.\n\n Ah, aah... D-da...ri... Ngh...nnngh...\n\nD, Beholder of Death Location and Questline in Elden Ring:\nD, Beholder of Death can be found at Nokron, Eternal City, east of the Great Waterfall Basin grace, against the railing of the balcony just outside the Valiant Gargoyle boss arena in the Siofra Aqueduct. [Map Link]\nAttempting to interact with him awards the player with the Inner Order gesture.\nIf given the unaltered Twinned Set, he can be summoned to assist with the Valiant Gargoyle and Valiant Gargoyle (Twinblade) in the Siofra Aqueduct, next to where he can initially be found.  Reloading the map or observing his summon sign will make him disappear from his initial location.He can next be found at Fia's location in the Deeproot Depths, if the player has received the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince from her and given him the Twinned Set. After reloading the area he will be found gloating over her corpse, finding her dead. [Map Link]\nHowever, the Twinned Set has one of the highest vitality stats in the game which is very important for surviving death blight. You can wear the helm, chest and gloves of the set and pair it with the knight boots for high vitality and 51 poise. It is not recommended to give the set to him early for this reason.\nAfter interacting with him next to Fia, exhausting his dialogue, and reloading the area again, he will have vanished, leaving the Twinned Set and the Inseparable Sword behind.\nIf the player has acquired the Twinned Set from Darian, Hunter of the Dead by killing him at his first location and given Devin the Twinned set, he will instead turn hostile upon reloading the area and attack the player. He will drop the Twinned Set and Inseparable Sword if defeated.\n\nGiving him the armor when Fia is unavailable means you cannot get it back until a certain point in the game progression.\nThis NPC moves.\nThis NPC can be fought (either at the end of Fia's questline, or at his initial location, if the player killed D in Limgrave).\nIf defeated, drops: \n\nTwinned Helm\nTwinned Armor\nTwinned Gauntlets\nTwinned Greaves\nInseparable Sword \n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: D, Beholder of Death\nWhen spoken to before questline progression\n\n<sleeping>\n\nAfter giving Twinned Armor\n\n"Ah, aah...D-da...ri...Ngh...nnngh..."\n\nAfter giving Twinned Armor and reloading the area, if D was killed by the player at Limgrave\n\n(Combat) "You will know vengeance for Darian.The wrath of D..."\n\nFinding him at Fia's body\n\n"Ha! Prince of Death, take a good long look!See the wrath of the Golden Order! The Order's justice, writ in blood!This is what's become of your precious witch! Naught but expired meat and bone!Look at this rotten w.h.o.r.e. No more children can be got from this useless flesh!Behold, your mother is dead!Heh heh heh heh...This is revenge, you witch! And you, you ghoul! This is the wrath of D!"\n\nTalking to him afterwards\n\n"Ah. Hello.The rotten witch is dead. The Golden Order, unsullied.Now I can look my brother Darian in the eye.Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit."\n"Darian, now I have no regrets.Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit."\n\nWhen attacked\n\n(Warning) "Oof!""What's the meaning of this? Has she bewitched you?"\n(Combat) "Very well. Then you are a blight. A defiler of the Golden Order, and murderer of my brother. Die! Die! Die!""I'll grind your corpse into that vile wench's rotting remains. A witch's eternal embrace, just as you wished!"\n(On player kill) "You defiled cretin. My brother is now avenged!"\n\nWhen killed\n\n"How could this...Forgive me, Darian... D-Darian..."\n\nElden Ring D's Twin Brother Notes & Trivia\n\nA golden barrier is protecting him at his first location if rolling, jumping or attacking (near) him.\nHe is first mentioned (unless the player kills his brother in Limgrave) in Rogier's Letter.\nHis name is Devin; D mentions his name when apologizing whilst dying if the player kills him at Limgrave.\nIf provoked after giving him the armor, D's Brother wields the Inseparable Sword and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast Discus of Light.\nKilling him for his gear is unnecessary: exhausting his dialogue after he kills Fia and reloading the area by resting at the nearby grace will result in him vanishing, with his gear left behind at the spot he was standing.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
