QUESTION
Why would killing certain NPCs end or skip specific quests in the game?

ANSWER
Killing certain NPCs would end or skip specific quests in the game because these NPCs are integral to the progression and completion of those quests, leading to locked out questlines or premature endings due to their key roles and interactions in the quests.
