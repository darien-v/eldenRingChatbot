CONTEXT
\n\n Rya \n\nReal Form (click to reveal)\n\nLocation\nVolcano Manor\n\nRole\nScout\n\nVoiced by\nEllie Heydon\n\nRya is an NPC in Elden Ring. Rya acts as a scout for the Volcano Manor, and is the adopted daughter of Tanith.\n\nA pleasure to meet you, Brave Tarnished.\n\nRya Location in Elden Ring\nRya can be found at Volcano Manor. [Map Link]\nEnd of Questline Location [Map Link]\n\nThis NPC moves\nThis NPC can be fought \n\nShe cannot be harmed until she moves into the Volcano Manor dungeon\n\nIf defeated, drops: Daedicar's Woe\n\nRya Questline: Points of Failure\n1. If you join the Volcano Manor without speaking to Rya at Liurnia of the Lakes, you will lose access to Blackguard Big Boggart and his questline for the rest of that playthrough, as he will refuse to speak with you if you haven't spoken with Rya in the swamp about retrieving a necklace from someone who stole it. This will also render you unable to purchase Boiled Prawn and Boiled Crab. (However, you can enter the Manor and touch the grace in the room where Tanith and her knight protector reside without losing access to Blackguard Big Boggart's questline as long as you do not speak to Tanith or anyone else in the Manor.)\n2. If you kill Rykard before speaking to Rya in her room inside the dungeon, she will disappear from the manor and her quest will become impossible to complete.\n\nRya Questline: How to complete Rya's Quest\n\nFirst meet her at Liurnia of the Lakes under the pavilion next to the Birdseye Telescope north of Laskyar ruins. Exhausting her dialogue she will ask you to retrieve a necklace from someone who stole it. [Map Link]\nHead north west from the pavilion until you reach the Boilprawn Shack and its Site of Grace.\nSpeak to the thief there, Blackguard Big Boggart, who will offer to sell Rya's Necklace back to you for 1000 runes. Alternatively, you can kill him and it will drop. \n\nNOTE: Killing Boggart here will lock you out of being able to complete his quest later\n\nReturn the necklace to her and she will reward you with a Volcano Manor Invitation.She will also tell you about the two main ways to reach Altus Plateau.\nWhen reaching Altus Plateau, you can talk to Rya, and she will teleport you inside Volcano Manor. Depending on which route you took to first reach the plateau, she can be found at one of two locations: \n\nthe lower part of Lux Ruins, up the stairs from the Erdtree-Gazing Hill site of grace, if you went through the Ruin-Strewn Precipice first\nthe top of Grand Lift of Dectus, to the left of the top of the stairs leaving the lift platform, if you used the lift first\nNOTE: If she does not appear at either of these locations, try teleporting to the Grand Lift and riding it to the top again to trigger her spawn.\nNOTE: You can reach Leyndell, Royal Capital through Fia's questline. If done so, Rya won't appear at either of these locations.\n\nAfter joining Volcano Manor and completing the first part of Tanith questline (i.e., assassination of Old Knight Istvan) she will move to a different room in the manor and appear in her snake form. Speaking to her during her snake form will progress the questline. \n\nNOTE: If you do all contracts in the Volcano Manor, to the point where you get ported to Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy from Tanith, she will no longer have dialogue related to Rya and you will be unable to pursue her optional objectives in this questline.\n\nComplete the second part of Tanith questline: assassination of Rileigh the Idle\nShe will be in human form in the same room where she was seen in her snake form.  she complains about hearing noises in the adjacent room: a clue to the secret passage therein. She asks you to investigate. To proceed in the questline, enter the illusory wall in the room right of hers and reach the grace in Prison Town Church. [Map Link] Return to Zorayas and tell her what you have seen to continue. \n\nNOTE: You must open the doors leaving Prison Town Church to continue in the questline.\n\n(OPTIONAL) Speak to Lady Tanith and choose the "Zorayas' troubles" option.\nDefeat Godskin Noble in the Temple of Eiglay [Map Link] to get the Serpent's Amnion.\nGive the Serpent's Amnion to Zorayas and she will disappear from the manor once you rest at the grace.\n(OPTIONAL - But crucial, see step #13 below) Speaking to Lady Tanith will have the new option "Zorayas' absence". She will give a Tonic of Forgetfulness to give to the upset Zorayas. \n\nIf you have already completed all the assassination contracts, you will not be able to get the Tonic till you defeat Rykard and have talked to her again. When she leaves the manor, she will leave the Tonic on her chair.\n\nZorayas has moved to the Legacy Dungeon's interior, in a small room adjacent to a lava pit filled with cages and skulls, just before a rope ladder. If you have fully unlocked the area, you can reach it by taking the wooden elevator next to the Temple of Eiglay, getting off at a hidden doorway just below the lift's highest point, and heading straight through the room, out a window, and jump across a lava floe. She is inside the room directly across.\n\nIf the elevator is not yet active, you can reach the lava floe (or unlock the elevator) by jumping off the balcony of the top floor of Temple of Eiglay. \n\nTo clarify - take the lift within the Temple of Eiglay (SE of the grace) up and go out through the door to reach the balcony. Jump down to the lava pit with slugs that leads to a rocky bridge you need to jump off, and then climb up the path afterwards. Hop across the lava to find a window on the left, but be ready for the Iron Virgin waiting behind the corner. Once inside there's a door to the right which leads to a bridge with a man-serpent - go passed him, the stairs, and then down the hall a bit to find a ladder in one of the windows to your left. You will find Rya in a small alcove at the bottom of it.\n\nYou can also reach this room by taking the wooden elevator to the top, going straight ahead toward the man-serpent with the lava sword, and jumping out the windows on the left. \n\nTo clarify - Turn NW from the Temple of Eiglay grace to find the door which leads to the lift if you have access. Right before it reaches the top there is a door leading to an open room with an enemy inside where you will find a window to jump out of. Straight across is Rya's alcove.\n\nIn her new location, the player is given a choice between three actions:. \n\nIf you kill her, she will transform back into a snake and drop Daedicar's Woe.\nIf you leave her alive and return after killing Rykard, she will have new dialogue. When you reset the area, she is gone and has left Daedicar's Woe and Zorayas' Letter in her place.\nIf you give her the Tonic of Forgetfulness, she simply goes to sleep. After Rykard is killed and the Manor's inhabitants have all left, she will return to her original location in the Manor. Exhaust her dialogue and reload the area to find Daedicar's Woe in her place.\n\nIf you get to Volcano Manor and complete her snake form questline before talking to Blackguard Big Boggart, the necklace won't trigger anything, so there is no reason to kill him for it(It is requested for his questline to buy it).\nIf you kill Rykard before speaking to Rya in her room inside the dungeon, it appears that she will disappear from the manor.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Rya\nAt Liurnia of the Lakes\n\nHello.It's rather chilly here, isn't it? My mistress sent me off on an errand...But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind. Could I ask you to lend a hand, perhaps?That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it.Only... He, too, is Tarnished. If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...\n\nHear the Request\n\nOhh, thank you dearly. What a blessing that we've met like this.The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...Please, I must have the necklace back.\n\nUpon attacking / rolling / jumping\n\nPlease, stop, Brave Tarnished.You will only tire by striking this barrier.Besides I'm no foe of yours. Please think this over.\nI see you've reconsidered. Thank goodness.\n\nGive Rya's Necklace\n\nOh, yes, that is my missing necklace. Thank you kindly. I am in your debt.Did I forget to announce myself?I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house. You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.Please, take this. (Volcano Manor Invitation)\nBrave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.Most Tarnished are Doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree...But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.\nOhh, and... One more thing, only for you...This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road.But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage.Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.I have faith in you, A champion, through and throught.I do hope that we can meet again.\n\nAt the Grand Lift of Dectus/Lux Ruins\n\nI've been waiting for you. I knew you had the stuff of champions. I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor. Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.\n(Accept) Give me your hand.I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.\n\nAt Volcano Manor\n\n(If she teleported you to Volcano Manor) Hello again. Brave Tarnished.As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor.Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.\n(If she didn't teleport you) Hello again. Brave Tarnished.It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand, but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.\n(If you haven't met her before) A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished. I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.\n\nAfter completing the first Volcano Manor quest\n\nHave you ever...heard any strange sounds here at the manor?Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales...Oh fie what am I saying? It just isn't possible. I must be tired.\nSometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls. Like breathing, or slithering scales.Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.\n\nAfter completing the second Volcano Manor quest\n\nBrave Tarnished, what is your business here? I'm afraid this is not a guest room.What's that peculiar look upon your face?Goodness, am I still a serpent? Oh, how dreadful... How dreadful indeed...Forgive my distress. I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance.Brave Tarnished. This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas.Please forgive the deception. Do understand. The duplicity is my own doing.Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.\nLady Tanith is my mother. I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king.That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. I am proud of what I am.But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, the wouldn't speak to me.And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits.But you are not like the rest. \nMy serpentine form, and the name Zorayas, were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I.Now I share the secrets with you, as well. Please keep them safe from anyone else.\n\nAfter speaking to Tanith and reloading the area\n\nUm, oh, it's you. Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late. Hmm, well... I know I can trust you...I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night. It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.If I'm not mistaken, it took the form of a serpent, just like me... Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret, that Lady Tanith has kept from me?I realise that I shouldn't impose but, if you discover anything, would you please share?\n\nTell her of the dark side of Volcano Manor\n\nReally... Oh, so there was a secret after all... Oh my...Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...Was I not... born by the grace of a king?\n\nGiving her the Serpent's Amnion\n\nI remember this scent, distinctly. Funny, isn't it. I am certain of it. I was born inside this. It's a part of my birth mother.You have my gratitude. Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid.I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.\n\nAt Volcano Manor's dungeon\n\nOh, it's you... I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you.I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual.Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents. Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me.I know that you have done so much for me. But I wish to ask one last kindness. Kill me, please.I thought that I feared nothing. But this... Free me from this accursed frame.\n\nAccept her request\n\nAgh... Thank you... My champion... Mother...\n\nGive Tonic of Forgetfulness\n\nYes, of course. You always were very kind.\nAhh... How delightfully sweet... And yet...\n\nAfter Rykard is defeated & tonic was given\n\nOh, it's you. Heaven knows what happened here, but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone.It feels rather quiet without them. But with you here, things will be just fine.\nI await Lady Tanith. I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king. I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern.Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour. I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes.\n\nAfter Rykard is defeated and you leave her be\n\nYou're not willing to kill me, are you. Hah... You've always been so kind. And uncompromising.\nI suppose I knew in my heart of hearts. How kind, and uncompromising, you always were.\n\nElden Ring Rya Notes & Trivia\n\nA golden barrier is protecting her at her first location if rolling, jumping or attacking (near) her.\nOn the map (post-1.03), her name is displayed as Zorayas the Scout, if the she told the player her true name.\n\n Rya Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
