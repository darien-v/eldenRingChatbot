Though not a demigod, Rennala is one of the shardbearers who resides in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Rennala is a powerful sorceress, head of the Carian Royal family, and erstwhile leader of the Academy. Rennala is an optional boss, and doesn't need to be defeated in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, she is a shardbearer, and two of the five available shardbearers must be defeated before entering Leyndell, Royal Capital. In addition, she must be defeated to achieve a certain ending.\nOnce defeated, Rennala becomes a friendly NPC who can be used to reassign your character's stats.\n\n Hush, little culver. I'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure…\n\nElden Ring Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss, but is required to achieve a certain ending and to use Larval Tears to respec your Character.\nClosest Site of Grace: Debate Parlor\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nIn Phase 1, Rennala is usually surrounded by a bubble which will block all attacks and the arena is filled with Juvenile Scholars who attack the player. One of these scholars at a time will have a golden aura surrounding its head. Hit three of these glowing Juvenile Scholars to temporarily break Rennala's bubble, causing her to crash to the floor and become vulnerable to attacks.\n\nElden Ring Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon Location\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon can be found after taking the elevator of the Raya Lucaria Academy.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 326 / 424 / 714 / 1171\nScarlet Rot: 326 / 424 / 714 / 1171\nHemorrhage: 326 / 424 / 714 / 1171\nFrostbite: 326 / 424 / 714 / 1171\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

It's not a bad idea to switch to a weapon with a fast attack like Fists to hit the Juvenile Scholars, since they'll stop reinforcing Rennala's bubble after only one hit. Once she starts falling, switch back to your main weapon and charge up a heavy attack so it lands as soon as she's vulnerable. Keep attacking until you see her start to glow, then retreat to avoid getting hit by her powerful Light Explosion.\nPhase 2: This phase is much easier for melee players than magic users, since Rennala is relatively weak to physical damage and staggers very easily. Keep hitting her as much as you can and you'll be able to disrupt most of her attacks, particularly if you use a lighter weapon that can attack repeatedly without using too much stamina. If she retreats or you need to regain stamina, make sure to roll through her magic before engaging again. The biggest risk is her summons: focus on blocking or dodging them as much as you can and wait for them to disappear before attacking her again, but keep her in view as well since she'll keep attacking you while the summons are present.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nRennala has extremely high Magic negation, so the best option across both phases is to simply grab a melee weapon that scales with Intelligence or Faith and treat this as a melee fight. If you insist on casting spells, Rock Sling is the best Sorcery for the job since it mostly deals Physical damage, although you'll also want a faster option like Glintstone Pebble to deal with the Juvenile Scholars in Phase 1. Incantation users are at less of a disadvantage since Rennala's elemental negations are only moderately high, but they should still consider using Bestial Incantations for their physical damage as well.\nIn Phase 2, stay a good distance away from Rennala so that you can avoid most attacks by running rather than rolling. Wait for openings after her attacks to start charging spells. When she has a summon, focus on not getting hit and wait for it to dissipate before focusing again on attacking.\n\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nPhase 1\n\nLight Explosion\nAs she lies on the ground, charges light in her hand and then releases it in a small area around her before recreating her bubble and floating back into the air\nMove back as soon as you see her hand filling with light\n\nChandelier Drop\nSmall flames appear in a circle on the floor before she drops a chandelier from the ceiling, dealing lots of damage\nAvoid the burning circles\n\nGravestones\nLevitates a few Juvenile Scholars into the air and transforms them into glowing gravestones, then sends them flying at the player. Only used once her shield has been broken at least once\nJust keep moving and the attack will usually miss, or take cover behind a solid pillar (the gravestones will shoot through bookshelves)\n\nJuvenile Scholars\n\nFire Breath\nRaises her candles and blows a short stream of fire\nRun away or dodge to the side\n\nHeadbutt\nRams the player with her head. Only used when you're very close by\nDon't spend too much time too close to a scholar without killing her\n\nFlying Book\nSinging scholars levitate books and send them flying at the player, dealing a small amount of damage\nKeep moving and these will probably miss you\n\nFlying Globe\nSinging scholars levitate globes and send them flying slowly at the player, dealing substantial damage\nThese are easy to dodge if you see them, just stay aware of the room around you\n\nPhase 2\n\nComet Azur \nCharges magic in her staff briefly before shooting a beam of energy directly forward\nClose in while circling her at a 45° angle to avoid getting hit, then take advantage of the long recovery to attack\n\nStar Shower\nSwings her staff in an arc, summoning magical stars which fly at the player after a short delay\nRun to either side or roll forward through the stars\n\nGlintstone Cometshard\nPulls her staff over her left shoulder while levitating forward, then shoots a single large projectile at the player\nRoll forward through the cometshard\n\nShattering Crystal\nSummons a large crystal in front of her, then shatters it and send the shards flying in a large area in front of her\nRoll forward through the shards or block\n\nGlintstone Pebbles\nSummons a line of crystals in front of her, then sends them flying at the player\nRun to either side or roll through the pebbles\n\nRennala's Full Moon\nCurls up into the air and transforms into a full moon, dispelling your magic. After a pause, she leaves the moon and sends it floating towards you, after which it explodes\nRun away and stay outside the ripples in the water to avoid the moon's explosion\n\nTwirling Toss\nThrows her staff directly in front of her where it spins in place briefly before returning\nRoll forward, attack, then roll to the left to avoid getting hit as the staff returns\n\nTwirling Spiral\nThrows her staff in a wide spiral around her\nRoll forward and stay in front of her to avoid getting hit and get in a few hits\n\nTwirling Retreat\nTwirls her staff vertically in front of her as she levitates backwards\nAvoid running into the twirling staff\n\nSummon Wolves\nKneels, blasts nearby players away without dealing damage, then summons four Lone Wolf spirits. These will vanish on their own after a few seconds, and can be resummoned even if they're killed. Only used below 60% HP\nThese are very weak, so just kill them and keep attacking Rennala\n\nSummon Knight\nKneels, blasts nearby players away without dealing damage, then summons a Bloodhound Knight spirit. It will vanish on its own after a few seconds, and will not be resummoned if it's killed. Only used below 60% HP\nKill this if you can to prevent it from being resummoned, but if you can't deal enough damage fast enough it's fine to just dodge it\n\nSummon Dragon\nKneels, blasts nearby players away without dealing damage, then summons a Dragon spirit. This will vanish on its own after a few seconds, and will not be resummoned if it's killed. Only used below 60% HP\nThis is way too tough to kill before it vanishes, so just focus on dodging its attacks. Stay  to avoid its fire and run towards it when it flies up\n\nSummon Troll\nKneels, blasts nearby players away without dealing damage, then teleports away as she summons a Troll spirit which immediately does a slamming attack. This will vanish on its own after a few seconds, and will not be resummoned if it's killed. Only used below 60% HP\nThis vanishes very quickly on its own, so just focus on dodging its attacks\n\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actress: Mali Rhys Harries\nHelping other people before defeating boss on your own may cause this boss fight to vanish with Rebirth option being locked on that NG cycle, as Rennala NPC does not spawn. (further testing required)\nThe stage of the second phase of the fight is reminiscent of  the one of Rom, the Vacuous Spider, one of the main story bosses in Bloodborne, another From Software title.  \n\nThe second half of the fight is not against Rennala, but against some sort of fail-safe illusion designed to protect Rennala, likely created by Ranni. \n\nThere are currently two bugs you may encounter while fighting Rennala: \n\nThe protective golden bubble may fail to spawn around Rennala when loading the area. If this happens you will not be able to damage Rennala and thus cannot progress past the first phase. You will need to re-load the area to correct it.\nThe golden aura scholar who sustains Rennala's shield may not spawn. You will need to re-load the area to correct it.\n\nFirst phase can't be finished while Rennala is in bubble. If her health is downed to 1 HP due to Poison/Scarlet Rot, she will fall on ground with no protection and has to be finished there.\nThis boss is fairly straightforward to fight for melee users, and staggers easily in either phase of the fight. It is possible to pass Phase 1 after breaking the shield a single time, and in Phase 2 it is possible to stagger her out of spellcasting or stun-lock her with a fast weapon. On defeat as a Furled Finger Cooperator the player is rewarded 10 000 runes, making this boss a reasonably efficient way for melee users to farm runes mid-game without following the Bloody Finger Invader questline.\nSpirit Ashes summoned during 2nd phase are associated with Ranni's servants:\n\nTroll - War Counselor Iji\nDragon - Glintstone Dragon Adula\nKnight - Unknown, but likely Bloodhound Knight Darriwil\nPack of wolves - Blaidd (or possibly more literally the three wolves that guard the front of Ranni's tower, or even the Lone Wolf Ashes she gives you.)\n\nThis boss was likely based on cut content for Dark Souls III, relating to a boss encounter with Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth. Some similarities are shown between her and Rennala, as they both focus on rebirthing and those that become born anew often are left disfigured or grotesque, alluding to both the Juvenile Scholars and the Man-Grubs. \nBug: Despite being resistant to sleep in her first phase, sleep seems to have no effect on her, stagger including.\n\nDialogue\nIntroduction:\nHush, little culver.\nI'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure...\nDuring Fight:\nCome, sweetings, time to be born, anew. (Spoken when using her Scholar Tomes attack)\nCome, Oath-sworn giant/dragon! (Spoken when summoning a giant or dragon during her second phase)\nSecond phase transition cutscene:\nAhh, my beloved...\nHave no fear, I will hold thee. Patience.\nYe will be countless born, forever and ever.\n(Note: While there is more dialogue in this cutscene, it is spoken by Ranni the Witch.\nUpon my name as Ranni the Witch.Mother's rich slumber shall not be disturbed by thee.Foul trespasser.Send word far and wide.Of the last Queen of Caria, Rennala of the Full Moon.And the majesty of the night she conjureth.)\nDefeating player:\nBe not afeard, little culver.

(Phase 2)\nAfter Fight:\nOh little Ranni, my dear daughter.\nWeave thy night into being.\n(Note: For Rennala's dialogue once she becomes an NPC, see Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC))\n\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon (Phase 2) Combo Chart\n\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
