This is not an optional boss as players must defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring.\n\nThe black flame could once slay gods. But when Maliketh sealed Destined Death, the true power of the black flame was lost.\n\nElden Ring Godskin Duo Boss\n\nThis fight has a single shared health bar that must be fully depleted to win the fight\nIf you kill either Godskin, the other will use a special move to resurrect it shortly afterwards\nIf you kill both Godskins, one of them will resurrect on its own shortly afterwards\nThis is not an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Dragon Temple Transept\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: Knight Bernahl. You can find his summon sign near either entrance to the boss arena.\n\nElden Ring Godskin Duo Location\nFrom the Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace, just head north to the boss arena's fog gate. [Map Link]\nWhen you first encounter this fight, you're likely to approach it from the Dragon Temple Site of Grace. However, there are two Banished Knights between this Site of Grace and the boss door making the boss run both long and risky. The Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace can be reached by jumping off the ledge directly west of the Dragon Temple Site of Grace, then turning around and jumping to an even lower platform and heading east.\nGodskin Duo Combat information\n\nHealth: 26,350 HP\nDrops 170,000, Ash of War: Black Flame Tornado, Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing [4] (NG only)\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n26,350\n26,560\n29,216\n30,544\n31,872\n34,528\n35,856\n37,184\n\nRunes\n170,000\n340,000\n374,000\n382,500\n408,000\n416,500\n425,000\n433,500\n\nGodskin Apostle Combat information\n\nHealth: 6,668 HP \nDefense: 118\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nDamage: Slash, Pierce, Fire\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 0\nSlash: -10\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 0\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 40\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked.

Refer to Sleep Strat below.\nUse the Hoarfrost Stomp skill and spam it behind a pillar. Refer to Hoarfrost Stomp Strat below.\nFor Incantations, Dragon Communion spells can be used throught pillars. Borealis's Mist will prove useful.\nThe structures in the arena are your allies, use them to gain space to heal, or to separate them and fight them one at a time.\nIf you use a Spirit Ash, don't stall too much as your Spirit ally won't last too much, so be aggressive while the Spirit Ash is active.\nThe Commander's Standard's weapon skill Rallying Standard can be used to increase the survivability of your Spirit Ash.\n\nGeneral Information\nThis boss fight is extremely tough to beat with most conventional methods owing to the fact that you are fighting two of the most difficult bosses together simultaneously. Additionally, each Godskin boss has an individual health bar in addition to the collective health bar labeled "Godskin Duo". Their collective bar is depleted as you deal damage to either boss, but depleting both bosses' health bars does not end the encounter. As long as the collective bar still has health, one or both bosses will re-appear and you will have to keep fighting and killing them over and over.\nWhen only one of the Godskins has been killed, the other one can perform an attack where it creates a sigil in the air over its head to resummon the other. This move leaves it quite vulnerable, but the newly-summoned Godskin can attack immediately so be wary when taking advantage of it. If both Godskins have been killed, one or the other will respawn even without this special attack.\nSleep Strategy\nOne way to deal with this duo is to use sleep-inducing items such as Sleepbone Arrows, Sleep Pots, Soporific Grease, or Sword of St. Trina to put one boss to sleep while you deal with the other. Once one is dead, wake the sleeping boss up and then let them re-summon their companion before putting them to sleep again. Rinse and repeat until their collective health bar is depleted. You could also summon a Mimic Tear  with Sleep Pots equipped, who uses pots often and won't purposefully wake the sleeping bosses. This saves the pots for multiple attempts and future use, at the cost of the Mimic Tear often using all its equipped pots quickly.\nHoarfrost Stomp Strategy\nAnother effective method is to imbue a weapon with Ashes of War: Hoarfrost Stomp and then summon your most powerful Spirit Ashes to distract one boss. Lure the other boss to one of the pillars while you stand behind it and keep spamming Hoarfrost Stomp which will deal its damage through the pillar. Be careful when they destroy a pillar, though: they can still get stuck on the base, but their attacks will go through. This strategy can be combined with the Sleep Strat above, but in that case you may want to refrain from using summons to avoid waking up the sleeping Godskin. If you summon Mimic Tear, it can also use Hoarfrost Stomp to deal massive damage to the bosses.\nMelee Users\nThis boss is extremely difficult to fight for exclusively melee users. The solo strategy revolves around having both the Godskin Noble and the Godskin Apostle within view at all times. They can both throw black fireballs, so you have to be incredibly cautious when attacking one, as the other could be throwing one if they're at a distance. It is also imperative to abuse the pillars around the arena, to block one from attacking you while you attack the other. However, once either one goes into their second phase, they will gain attacks that allow them to destroy these pillars. The Apostle's phase-two attacks are mostly slow and locked to a specific location, which can give you opportunities to get in a few attacks on the Noble. Most of the Noble's phase-two attacks aren't particularly threatening, but Godskin Wheel is very dangerous. It's likely to use this attack immediately upon entering phase two if you're some distance away from it, so your best bet is to stay close during the phase transition to force it to use the easily-dodgeable Godskin Crusher instead. If you can't, run behind a pillar—although the roll will destroy the top part of the pillar, the base will still block its movement. (Note that it can roll up onto a pillar at the very beginning of the attack, so try to hide behind one a little further away.)\nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor magic users, using the spell Comet Azur and a bow loaded with sleep arrows will trivialize the fight. Bait the Noble away from the Apostle, begin to fire around 5 arrows until the sleep sets in. Do not attack him. Then proceed to attempt to put the Apostle to sleep close to the Noble. After both Godskins are asleep, cast Terra Magica and drink a Wondrous Physick with Cerulean Hidden Tear. Line up the Godskins, target whichever one is further away to make sure the spell accurately hits both of them, then simply charge up and fire to watch their health melt away. Keep firing, even though their bodies will disappear their hitboxes will allow further damage for a short time. One will respawn and might attempt to resurrect the other, if this happens just use sleep arrows again and finish off their healthbar. For best results do not use any Spirit Ashes as they may awaken one of the Nobles. \n\nGodskin Duo Attacks & Counters\n\nWhile the Godskin Duo are fought simultaneously, they have the same movesets as their solo counterparts and have no added attacks or skills for this fight (aside from re-summoning their dead companion).\n\nRefer to the Godskin Apostle's page for its moveset and counters here.\n\nRefer to the Godskin Noble's page for its moveset and counters here.\n\nGodskin Duo Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThe Godskin Apostles' theme is not in Latin. Youtuber Antonius Tertius (aka redditor MAGISTER-ORGANI), a Latin scholar, contacted some music producers and confirmed the official lyrics and backstage information regarding their creation, which he published on his channel; the lyrics are mostly nonsensical latinish syllables and vowel sounds arranged in a way that makes them sound like some ancient language, thus they hold no meaning, no lore, just like most of the lyrics in the game. \nEven after a Godskin is dead, attacking its corpse will damage the shared health bar for a short time. \n\nPlayer can trigger Blood loss/Frostbite during that time, but this will bear no effect on Godskin Duo's healthbar. \n\nBug: Godskin Wheel always goes for the host, even if host did not attack the Noble\nBug (cooperation only): Resummoned Godskin does not skale with the number of players that were at the start of the fight. Instead, they will have same stats as if they were faced solo. \nThe Godskin Duo have an unused interaction where if one of them is put to sleep, the other will scream to wake them up. The reason it is unused is because it is bugged due to the Banished Knights patrolling the area as well as the hidden enemy that acts as the Godskin Duo's total HP.\nOwing to them being reused bosses, their ability to ressurect the other, and their movesets being accused of not properly complementing the other in other duo fights, fans often rank the Godskin Duo as one of the worst bosses in FromSoftware history.\n\nGodskin Duo Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n

QUESTION
How can players effectively defeat the Godskin Duo boss in Elden Ring using a strategic approach?

ANSWER
Using a strategic approach, players should consider utilizing sleep-inducing items to put one boss to sleep while focusing on the other, and using Hoarfrost Stomp behind pillars to deal damage and distract the bosses simultaneously to defeat the Godskin Duo in Elden Ring.
