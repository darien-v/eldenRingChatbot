CONTEXT
\n\n Gideon Ofnir \n\nLocation\nRoundtable Hold\n\nRole\nGuide and Lore NPC\n\nVoiced by\nJoe McGann\n\nGideon Ofnir is an NPC in Elden Ring. Gideon Ofnir is the leader of Roundtable Hold and a profound source of knowledge. He can be found most commonly at his office, absorbed by an endless amount of books.\n\nAs a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.\n\nGideon Ofnir Location in Elden Ring\nGideon Ofnir can be found at Roundtable Hold.\n\nThis NPC changes locations, both within Roundtable Hold and the Lands Between, as the story progresses. \n\nGideon Ofnir Questline: How to complete Gideon Ofnir's Quest\nGideon Ofnir is the leader of Roundtable Hold, and the foster parent of Nepheli Loux. As an NPC, he provides lore on the shardbearers and can point players towards their objective. He is also involved in a multitude of quests.\n\nWhen you first meet Gideon Ofnir, he makes it clear that you are not a true member of the Roundtable, but a mere visitor. In order to be accepted as such, you'd have to obtain a Great Rune and receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.\nAfter finding your first Great Rune, Gideon will detail the location of other major shardbearers\nAfter defeating Morgott, the Omen King, Gideon will provide the names of additional more-secluded shardbearers, and reward you for bringing him information on their location.  \n\nAfter reaching Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum, telling Gideon rewards you with Fevor's Cookbook [3].\nAfter reaching Miquella's Haligtree, he rewards you with Black Flame's Protection.\nAfter killing Mohg, Lord of Blood, talking to him rewards you with Law of Causality.\nAfter killing Malenia, Blade of Miquella, he rewards you with Lord's Divine Fortification.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Gideon Ofnir\nIntroduction\n\nOh, this is a rare occasion. I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard.\nAllow me a word of advice, as your senior. You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more.A house guest, yet to earn their keep. Remember your place, newcomer.\nThere's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.\n\nNext visit after introduction\n\n"What do you need? I have little time to spare".\n[What do you mean, a house guest?]\n\n"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.If those words held any meaning to you...Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.\n"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.As a true member of the Roundtable. I have high hopes for you".I'm sick and tired of them. These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain...\n"We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to".\n\nAfter speaking to Enia (requires at least one Great Rune)\n\nYou've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not? Then, just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable. I am known as Gideon Ofnir. As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing. You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.\n\nVisit\n\nYou'll be after more Great Runes, now eh? Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge. The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers. We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir. Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell. And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.\n... You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?\n\n§About Godrick\n\nSo. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil. Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power. His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest, but I suspect you know that well enough already.\n\nAbout Radahn\n\nGeneral Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior. He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east. And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat. I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire. And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid. Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...\n\n§About Rykard\n\nPraetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir. He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour. The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree. It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering. Rykard has commited the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven.\n\n§About Morgott\n\nMorgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city. It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau. But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there. Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring. Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait.\n\nAbout Rennala and Raya Lucaria Academy\n\nThe Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia. Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy. But Rennala herself is no demigod. Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort. The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.\n\nAbout Nepheli\n\nI understand you've been speaking to Nepheli. She is my daughter. I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace. Tough a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes. So I put her to work. Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you. Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle. \n[After beating the Omenkiller in Albinauric Village] Ahh, you've already heard? Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions. So I have no further use for her. Honestly, what's a man to do. A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly. I suspect... that's just what the Queen wants. A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished.\n\nShowing Seluvis's Potion\n\nIs that potion what I think it is? Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again.Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must. The Roundtable has no code to speak of.  But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?\n[Hand over Seluvis's Potion] Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself. You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away. Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold.\n[Don't hand it over] Well, I won't force you. But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste. She's not herself right now, and though I have no need for her, she still has potential. Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet.\n\nAfter defeating Ensha\n\nOh, my apologies for that nasty business. Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems. As his master, I'd like to express my regret. But now, Ensha is slain and gone. Finished, forever more. \nAh, yes, by way of apology, allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess. Find the Albinauric woman. She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia. She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.\n\nAfter obtaining a second Great Rune\n\nWell. I see you've found another Great Rune. Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.Make the journey. To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer. You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace.\n\nAfter defeating Morgott, the Omen King\n\nWhere should I go? \n\n"If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin".The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago."\n\nUnlocated demigods\n\n"There are four more demigods yet to be located. Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed. His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman. Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala. And the one only known as the Lord of Blood. Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers. If you should learn anything of these matters, I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me. We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord. As such, I hope we are compelled to work together."\n\nAfter Nepheli Loux leaves for Stormveil Castle Throne Room\n\nI hear you helped get the girl back on her feet.Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you. Sorry. For the time you had to waste.\n\nAfter reaching Consecrated Snowfield\n\nAhh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.You've made more of yourself than Ensha has...Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath.\n\n§After reaching Miquella's Haligtree\n\nAhh, so the secret medallion led you to the land of the Haligtree?I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.But...with the Haligtree as it is... I suppose Miquella must already be...Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me.You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.[Gives Black Flame's Protection]\n\nAfter defeating Malenia, Blade of Miquella\n\nSo. The Haligtree, now but a husk... I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.Indeed, it seems those words held weight. How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified... Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me.You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.[Gives Lord's Divine Fortification]\n\nAfter reaching Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum\n\nOh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as the are - distant and unattainable.But perhaps it's worth looking into... If what I've heard is right, then maybe...Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:A secret rite known only to me.You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.[Gives Fevor's Cookbook (3)]\n\n§After defeating Mohg, Lord of Blood\n\nAhh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all! That is some fine intelligence indeed!With it, the final clue has been brought into the light.One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.As promised, allow me to impart to you the last of the secret rites known only to me.[Gives Law of Causality]\nWell I wonder what comes next...If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all will be well.But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me...\n\n§After the cutscene at the Forge of the Giants\n\nYou...burned the Erdtree, didn't you? Then the Roundtable is soon to follow. Ah, no need to fret about that. The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen, then the Roundtable must go as well.\nI'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time. I must learn all that can be taken from this place, and sear it into my memory.How could I call myself the All-Knowing if I did any less?\nThe pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.Perhaps the same could be said about guidance.Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord?\n\nElden Ring Gideon Ofnir Notes & Trivia\n\nFurther into the game's progression, Gideon Ofnir becomes a Boss fight.\nAfter you defeat Maliketh, the Black Blade, he leaves Roundtable Hold.\nIf he leaves before you get some rewards for information about the other shardbearers, the rewards can be bought from the Twin Maiden Husks once the appropriate progression is completed.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
