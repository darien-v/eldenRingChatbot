The Silver Mirrorshield is a Shield that scales primarily with Strength and Intelligence. It is a very good shield for mages and spellblades and highly resistant to magic. Medium Shields feature a good balance between defense and weight, which is great for most situations in combat. Although it may not be as light as a Small Shield which is good for agility and parrying, a Medium Shield works better at reducing damage and blocking.\n\nShield of radiant silver, festooned with amber and carried by Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree.\nThe shape is said to imitate that of a sacred drop of dew, which inspired the absurd rumor that Loretta herself was an Albinauric.\n\nWhere to Find Silver Mirrorshield in Elden Ring\nThe Silver Mirrorshield Shield can be found at the following location:\n\nFound in the northern area of Consecrated Snowfield, inside the Apostate Derelict destroyed church.[Elden Ring Map here]\n\nElden Ring Silver Mirrorshield Notes & Tips\n\nShield Skill: No Skill\nThis shield cannot be infused with Ashes of War.\nSell Value: 100\nYou can use your weapon skill without having to unequip the shield first.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
