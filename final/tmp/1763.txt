These tall warriors are clad in golden armor with distinct tufts of decorative crimson fur. They wield a thrusting sword, alongside a spear or a scythe and are found as bosses in multiple locations. This is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, doing so yields useful Items and Runes.\nThe Cleanrot Knights serve Malenia, Blade of Miquella, and fought with her against General Radahn's army during the Shattering. They remain loyal to her despite knowing that they will eventually succumb to the scarlet rot.\nLesser Cleanrot Knight is the normal enemy form of this boss. The spirit of a Cleanrot Knight can be summoned for aid in battle using Cleanrot Knight Finlay Ashes.\n\n The Cleanrot Knights vowed to fight alongside Malenia, despite the inevitable, if gradual, putrefaction of their flesh. Their acceptance of their fate made these battles fiercest of all.\n\nElden Ring Cleanrot Knight Location\n\nStillwater Cave (Spear) [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nAbandoned Cave (Spear & Sickle) [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nCleanrot Knight Combat information\n\nStance: 65\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nIs vulnerable to a backstab critical\nDamage: Standard, Pierce, Holy\nInflicts: Scarlet Rot\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 0\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: -20\nLightning: 0\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Cleanrot Knight Boss Guide\n\nCleanrot Knight Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Cleanrot Knight:\n\nDon't just keep attacking over and over—once it uses Spear Guard, back off or it'll counter-attack.\nUse Fire Pots. It's very weak to fire and has low health to begin with, so a single pot will do a lot of damage even at low levels\nLong windups and attack animations leave it very vulnerable to backstabs\n\nMelee Users\nBaiting: Stay close and towards its left to tempt it into using Spear Stab, Impale, or Sacred Phalanx. When it starts winding up one of these slow attacks, circle around behind it and get a backstab critical.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nWaiting Game: Don't underestimate the Cleanrot Knight's range. It may not have any ranged attacks, but Rushdown is very good at closing distance and Impale will do a lot of damage if it connects. If your spells take a while to cast, either make sure you're across the arena or it's distracted by your summons.\n\nCleanrot Knight Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSlash\nSwings the sword in its right hand\nBlock, roll backwards, or roll in the direction of the swing\n\nJab\nPulls back its right arm, then quickly stabs forward with its sword\nRoll to either side when you see its right arm pull back\n\nTriple Jab\nPulls back its right arm, then stabs forward twice quickly, then once more after a brief pause\nRoll to either side when you see its right arm pull back\n\nSpear Variant\n\nSpear Stab\nPulls its spear back for a second, then stabs it forward\nRoll to either side as you see its spear pass its head. If you have a quick weapon, you can get in a hit while it winds up\n\nTwin Stab\nHolds both its swords and spear pointing forward for a second, then stabs them both together in front of it\nThis doesn't have a lot of forward range, so you can easily move away during its long windup\n\nRushdown\nBrings its spear level with the ground and glowing golden, then runs forward with it extended. This is usually followed up with Impale.\nRoll to either side as soon as you see the spear start glowing\n\nImpale\nPulls back its spear, then thrusts the spear forward and up. If this hits, it will impale you and instantly inflict Scarlet Rot\nRoll to either side when you see it pull back its spear, and avoid getting hit by Rushdown\n\nSpear Guard\nCrosses its spear and sword in front of its chest, blocking attacks from the front\nKeep your distance and wait for it to put its guard down before attacking again\n\nGolden Shove\nCrosses its spear and sword if they aren't already. They glow with golden light as it shoves them forward\nRoll away when you see it cross its sword and spear\n\nSacred Phalanx\nLets its spear fall down behind it to its left, then drags it forward, leaving a golden glow on the ground that erupts into holy spears in a straight line.\nRoll around it clockwise, as its right flank is unprotected during this attack. Make sure to avoid the golden glow on the ground\n\nRetreating Phalanx\nExtends its spear forward and to its right, then drags it counterclockwise behind it while it steps backwards, leaving a golden glow on the ground that erupts into holy spears\nKeep back and avoid the golden glow on the ground, then close back in once the holy spears have vanished\n\n: Attack can be parried\nCleanrot Knight Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThey first appeared in a trailer back in E3 2019, seen stabbing Radahn with their spears.\nKnown as Noble Rot Knight in other languages, likely referring to the Botritis fungus that's used to make sweet wines\nSpear Variants are more aggressive than their Scythe wielding counterparts, often being the ones charging their opponents\n\nCleanrot Knight (Spear) Combo Chart\n\n Cleanrot Knight  Stillwater Cave  \n\nDrops\n3,300Winged Sword InsigniaCleanrot Knight's Sword\n\nHP\n1,980\n\nElden Ring Cleanrot Knight Boss (Stillwater Cave)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Stillwater Cave\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nCleanrot Knight Combat information\n\nHealth: 1,980 HP \nDefense: 107\nThis Cleanrot Knight wields a Cleanrot Spear\nThis variant can buff itself when it lands multiple consequetive hits, increasing its damage for a short while.\nDrops 3,300, Winged Sword Insignia, Cleanrot Knight's Sword\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: 530 / 820 / 1277\nHemorrhage: 324 / 422 / 712 / 1169\nFrostbite: 324 / 422 / 712 / 1169\n\nSleep: 235 / 277 / 375 / 665\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.

QUESTION
What are the different strategies for defeating the Cleanrot Knight boss in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Focus on backstabbing during long attack animations, use Fire Pots for its weakness, bait slow attacks for melee users, keep distance for magic/ranged users, and counter its specific attacks like Spear Stab or Impale.
