CONTEXT
\n\n Millicent ミリセント \n\nLocation\nChurch of the Plague\n\nRole\nQuest NPC and Summonable Cooperator\n\nVoiced by\nAllegra Marland\n\nMillicent is an NPC in Elden Ring with a quest line that players can complete in order to gain some valuable items. Millicent is a young woman stricken with an incurable case of Scarlet Rot. Gowry will send players to look for her in an attempt to cure her of Scarlet Rot. Progress through her questline in order to unlock her as an NPC Summon Cooperator during specific boss battles.\nMillicent can also be encountered as an NPC Invader. She will invade the player in the Swamp of Aeonia at all times of the day. She has light armor and appears to use a Shamshir, but with the Waterfowl Dance skill, the same as Malenia.\n\nI would rather trust you than simply continue to spoil from within. \n\nMillicent Location in Elden Ring\n\nMillicent can initially be found at Church of the Plague, around the northeast direction from Gowry's Shack. You need to light the first two braziers in Sellia, Town of Sorcery, then progress up the stairs north towards the Sellia Backstreets site of grace; the first two braziers unlock the barrier. Then go up the mountain towards the Church of the Plague, and she'll be next to the site of grace. [Map link]\nAfter giving her the Unalloyed Gold Needle, she will move on to Gowry's Shack. [Map link] \nMillicent can also be found in southern Altus Plateau. [Map link]\nAfter Godskin Apostle is defeated, Millicent can be found near the newly visible grace at the northern end of Windmill Village. [Map link]\nThis NPC moves.\nThis NPC can be fought.\nIf defeated as an NPC, drops:  6,000 runes, Millicent's Prosthesis (after she moved to the Windmill Village).\nMillicent appears as an NPC Invader, in the southeast of the Swamp of Aeonia, near the geysers and the Commander O'Neil boss fight. [Map link] \n\nAs an invader she is immune to Scarlet Rot, but susceptible to Poison.\n\nIf defeated as an invader, drops: Sacramental Bud x5, Golden Rune [3], Golden Rune [5], Golden Rune [10], and 316 Runes.\n\nNPC Summon Boss Fights: \n\nMagma Wyrm Makar: Available once you've given her the Unalloyed Gold Needle and she's decided to go on a journey, and tried to pay Gowry a visit.\nGodskin Apostle: You can summon Millicent for this boss, after giving her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis \nDraconic Tree Sentinel (Capital Outskirts): You can summon Millicent for this boss, after giving her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis, and defeating the Godskin Apostle in Windmill Village.\nBlack Blade Kindred (Forbidden Lands): Advance in her questline until you defeat Godskin Apostle in Windmill Village, and her summon sign will be available north of the Statue of Marika, on the "road" towards the boss.\nDoes not appear as a summon for Commander Niall, despite her dialogue stating that she would be heading toward him.  \n\nMillicent Questline: How to complete Millicent's Quest\nMillicent has a questline related to Gowry, but also appears as an NPC Invader at the Aeonia Swamp. The quest can be completed after reaching the Haligtree Roots site of grace, and can still be completed after defeating Malenia. The quest can be done quickly if the player defeats the bosses or otherwise obtains the quest items before exhausting dialogue.\nQuestline Objectives:\n\nSpeak with Gowry in his shack and he will ask for a favor. He wants help to heal a young girl, Millicent, found beyond Sellia, who has been infected with Scarlet Rot. To do this, he will ask you to seek an Unalloyed Gold Needle, which is dropped by Commander O'Neil, located in the Swamp of Aeonia. In return, he will share the secrets of the town of Sellia.  \n\nSpeaking to Gowry and accepting his quest will unlock Polyanna, Adopted Daughter's summon sign, north of O'Neil's battle arena.\n\nGive the Unalloyed Gold Needle to Gowry. He'll need some time to repair the needle and will give you Sellia's Secret.  \n\nWarp to a nearby site of grace or quit the game to reload, and he'll give you the repaired needle.\n\nBring the needle to Millicent at the Church of the Plague. You may need to complete the puzzle in Sellia, Town of Sorcery to open the path uphill. Or, coming from Dragonbarrow, jump down a Spirit Spring to the north of the Church.\nAfter Millicent uses the needle, rest at the nearby site of grace, then exhaust her dialogue. She will gift you the Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom. Upon reloading the area, she will have moved to Gowry's shack.\nReturn to Gowry's shack to find him gone, but Millicent there. Exhaust her dialogue. Reload the area, and Millicent will move, and Gowry will return. You can now purchase spells from him. \n\nMillicent can be summoned to fight Magma Wyrm Makar in the Ruin-Strewn Precipice after this point. This summon sign will disappear if she is given the Valkyrie's Prosthesis.\n\nMillicent will now be located just north-northeast of the Erdtree-Gazing Hill site of grace in Altus Plateau, standing near the edge of the cliff. [Map Link] \n\nThe player will need to go north to The Shaded Castle and retrieve the Valkyrie's Prosthesis, which is found in a chest in a room guarded by a single Cleanrot Knight, on the northwestern edge of the castle. Return to her, and give her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis item to advance her quest.\n\nGo to Dominula, Windmill Village, and defeat the Godskin Apostle. After giving Millicent the Prosthesis, her summon sign will appear at the base of the hill northwest of the Stake of Marika.\nAfter defeating the Apostle, rest at the Windmill Heights site of grace, and she will appear next to it. Exhaust her dialogue to continue the quest. [Map Link]\nMillicent can be summoned to fight the Black Blade Kindred boss in Forbidden Lands, even before defeating the Godskin Apostle.\nMillicent will move to the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins site of grace in Mountaintops of the Giants. Exhaust her dialogue to continue. [Map link] \n\nIf Millicent does not appear at the site of grace, try returning to the Windmill Heights again and see if she's there, and if so, exhaust her dialogue there.\n\nMillicent will move to the Prayer Room site of grace in Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree. She will not move from this spot until the player has defeated the nearby Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit mini-boss. To reach the mini-boss, go to the Drainage Channel site of grace, go west through the doorway, climb up the ladder at the end of the corridor, and go out the doorway on your right at the top. The mini-boss is at the landmass across the gap to the left. To reach it, go up the slope on the right and walk across the tree branch, heading southwest across the gap. [Map link]\nOnce the player has defeated the mini-boss, there will be two summon signs near where the mini-boss used to be. Specifically, on the northwest hill around the lake. The player can either: \n\nBe summoned into her world and help fight four NPC Invaders called Millicent's Sisters, granting you the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia upon completion. \n\nMary, Eldest Sister (wields a  Halo Scythe).\nMaureen, Second Sister (wields a Treespear).\nAmy, Third Sister (wields two Flowing Curved Swords).\nPolyanna, Youngest Sister (wields a Blade of Calling).\n\nBe summoned as an invader in order to challenge her, granting you Millicent's Prosthesis upon completion, but not the Unalloyed Gold Needle.\n\nIf the player chose to help Millicent, they can find her near where her summoning sign was, sitting by the rotten pool. Exhaust all of her dialogue, then reload the area. The Unalloyed Gold Needle is on the ground.\n\nThe Unalloyed Gold Needle can be used at the flower in Malenia's arena in order to receive Miquella’s Needle, as well as a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone. (Requires location reset after the fight)\n\nIf you return to Gowry, he will talk about Malenia and Millicent's connection. You will no longer be able to purchase from the Sage. \n\nIf you kill Gowry at this point, you will receive the Flock's Canvas Talisman and Gowry's Bell Bearing. If he is already dead, both items will still be obtainable from his corpse, found in Gowry's Shack.\n\nMillicent's Dialogue\n\n§Introduction\n～ \n\nChurch of the Plague, Caelid \n～ \n\n( 初対面 )\n\nAh...Ahh\n\nNggh... Who's there? \n\nWell, it matters not. \n\nIf you are wise, \n\nyou will leave, \n\nimmediately. \n\nMy flesh writhes with scarlet rot. \n\nIt is a curse. \n\nNot to be meddled with by man.\n\n§Upon giving her the Unalloyed Gold Needle \n～ \n   ( \n   「無垢金の針」を渡す ) \n\nYou ask that I stab myself with the needle... \n\nTo quell the scarlet rot? \n\nBut...how? \n\n... Never mind. \n\nI've decided. \n\nI would rather trust you, \n\nthan simply continue to spoil from within. \n\nWould you mind...\n\naverting your eyes for a moment? \n\nWell. \n\nThat was easier than expected. \n\nBut...\n\nwhy do I feel so...\n\n[ Upon reloading area ]\n\nI...hoped to see you again. \n\nMy apologies for when last we met. \n\nI fainted before I could even thank you. \n\nEverything is as you said. \n\nSince inserting the needle, \n\nthe scarlet rot has ceased to writhe. \n\nEven the nightmares have abated... \n\nAnd now, \n\nthough I can scarcely believe it myself, \n\nI can move as I please. \n\nIt is all thanks to you. \n\nNot that I could every truly repay you, \n\nbut I would like you to have this, \n\nby way of thanks. \n\nA token, though it is. \n\n[Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom]\n\nI'm considering leaving. \n\nOn a journey. \n\nWith the needle buried in my flesh, \n\nI've started to recall, \n\nbut dimly... \n\nMy destiny... \n\nMy name is Millicent. \n\nI pray fate permits us meet again.\n\nAttacking her after giving her the Unalloyed Gold Needle\n\n(Warning) Ugh. Is there something wrong? Please, cease this at once.\n(Combat) Why are you doing this? Now you've forced my hand.\n(On player kill) I will not forget what you did for me. But this day marks our farewell.\n\n§\nAt Gowry's Shack\n\n～ \n\n( ゴーリーのボロ家で ）\n\nOh, hello again. \n\nSomething about this place felt familiar to me. \n\nSo I decided to pay a visit, \n\nhoping to find someone here. \n\nBut I've only found emptiness. \n\nPerhaps before my departure, \n\nI needed someone to say farewell to. \n\nI must focus on my journey, \n\nfor which I have you to thank.\n\nI must stay strong. \n\nI must focus on my journey, \n\nfor which I have you to thank.\n\n§\nNorth of the Lux Ruins on the Altus Plateau\n\n～ \n\nErdtree-Gazing Hill Grace, N ～\n\n( ルクスの廃墟から北に )\n\nAh. We meet again. \n\nIn truth, it's been smooth sailing, \n\nfor me. \n\nThe scarlet rot has stilled, \n\nsince last we met. \n\nAs such, I've been able to continue my journey. \n\nI realise that if I still had my sword arm, \n\nI could have aided you in battle.\n\nNow, I'm tracing the path Malenia took, \n\nafter unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, \n\nduring her battle with General Radahn, \n\nin the Caelid Wilds. \n\nI should like to meet her, \n\nthis vanished woman. \n\nI think she's in the north. \n\nIn the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.\n\n§After giving her the Valkyrie Prosthesis ～(「 戦乙女の義手 」を渡す )\n\nAre you giving me this arm? \n\nI thank you. \n\nI am in your debt, yet again. \n\nI think, if the arm serves well enough, \n\nit might be possible for me to wield a sword again.\n\nIf the arm serves well enough, \n\nit might be possible for me to wield a sword again. \n\nPerhaps, then. \n\nI can aid you in battle.\n\n§\nAt\nDominula Windmill Village \n\n～After summoning her to aid you in battle withthe Godskin Apostle\n～ \n\nWindmill Heights, Grace\n\n～\n\n( 風車村ドミヌラ )\n\nAh, we meet yet again. \n\nThe arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder. \n\nIt feels just like my own, \n\neven handling a sword. \n\nPerhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, \n\nbut I am sure of my skill with the sword. \n\nThus, I would have you call upon me in battle, \n\nshould you ever have the need. \n\nIt is the only way that I can express my thanks.\n\n§In Mountaintops of the Giants ～Ancient Snow Valley Ruins, Grace ～( 古遺跡の雪谷 )\n\nTo think we'd meet in such a place... \n\nWhat could your purpose possibly... \n\nNo, I know well enough who you are, \n\nand what I know is good enough for me. \n\nCall upon me again in battle, \n\nshould you have the need.\n\nI'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins. \n\nI heard the master of the fort was given a medallion \n\nthat allowed him to visit the Haligtree. \n\nIndeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found. \n\nThe Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.\n\n§Near the Prayer Room Grace at \n\nElphael, Brace of the Haligtree   \n～ \n\n( 祈祷室 )\n\nAgain we meet. \n\nI can only surmise our purposes are aligned. \n\nIn which case, allow me to explain myself. \n\nI am of Malenia's blood. \n\nBut in what capacity I know not. \n\nI could be sister, \n\ndaughter, \n\nor an offshoot... \n\nWhatever the case though, \n\nI am certain of a kinship between us.\n\nThere is something I must return to Malenia. \n\nThe will that was once her own. \n\nThe dignity, \n\nthe sense of self, \n\nthat allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. \n\nThe pride she abandoned, \n\nto meet Radahn's measure.\n\n§After choosing to help Millicent at the end of her questline, \n\nlaying by the pool near where her summoning sign was.\n～ \n\n( お姉妹の4人と戦い後 )\n\nThank you for lending your hand. \n\nWithout your help, \n\nI could not have defeated that quartet. \n\nI feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end. \n\nThank you. \n\nWith your help, \n\nI was able to live as my own person, \n\nif only in passing. \n\nBut this is where things end. \n\nI pause to even tell you, but... \n\nI took out the needle myself. \n\nTell whoever put you up to this. \n\nThat if I am to flower into something other than myself, \n\nI would rather rot into nothingness as I am.\n\nPlease, let me pass alone. \n\nThe scarlet rot writhes now, \n\nworse than ever. \n\nSoon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh. \n\nCurse-laden. \n\nUntouchable. \n\nI wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm.\n\nKilling Millicent at the end of her questline in Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree before reloading the area\n\nI did not expect it to end like this. But I will not forget what you have done.\n\nAfter choosing to challenge Millicent\n\nAhh, how could you... Is this your true heart? Was I... was it all...for this?\n\nMillicent Notes & Trivia\nFAQ:How do you cure the girl with the Scarlet Rot Elden ring?\nIn order to cure Millicent from the Scarlet Rot players will need to speak to first speak to Gowry who will be at Gowry's Shack [Map Link], obtain the Unalloyed Gold Needle for him by defeating Commander O'Neil, located in the Swamp of Aeonia and he will repair it. Bring the repaired Unalloyed Gold Needle to Milliecet and she will use it to cure her Scarlet Rot. \nStep by Step Walkthrough\n\nSpeak with Gowry in his shack and he will ask you to seek an Unalloyed Gold Needle, which is dropped by Commander O'Neil, located in the Swamp of Aeonia. In return, he will share the secrets of the town of Sellia. \nDefeat  Commander O'Neil, located in the Swamp of Aeonia and obtain the needle then return it to Gowry. Give the Unalloyed Gold Needle to Gowry. He'll need some time to repair the needle and you will need to return to him. To speed up the process, look for to a nearby site of grace or quit the game to reload, and he'll give you the repaired needle. The closest site of grace is nearby just northeast of Gowry's Shack where the Church of the Plague. Return to Gowry to retrieve the needle then take it to Millicent. \nBring the needle to Millicent at the Church of the Plague. You may need to complete the puzzle in Sellia, Town of Sorcery to open the path uphill. Or, coming from Dragonbarrow, jump down a Spirit Spring to the north of the Church.\nAfter Millicent uses the needle, rest at the nearby site of grace in the same Locations, then return to Millicent and she will be well, which will tell you "Since inserting the needle ths scarlet rot has ceased to writhe." From this point onwards Millicent will be cured from scarlet rot and will be free to change Locations. You can follow her full questline here. \n\nMillicent Other Notes\n\nIn combat, Millicent wields a unique version of the Shamshir that has the Waterfowl Dance skill, which is normally only found on the Hand of Malenia. Before she receives the prosthesis, she uses it in her left hand, never two-handing it or doing anything else that would involve her right arm, and she won't use its skill either.\nWhen fighting her as an invader in the swamp, it is recommended to use Flame, Cleanse Me or Preserving Boluses to cleanse the Scarlet Rot.\nThe name "Millicent" comes from the old Germanic name Amalasuintha, composed of the words "Amal" which means "work" or "labor" and "Swinth", which means "strong". Alternatively, the French variation, Mélisande, means "brave strength". This fits directly back into Millicent's character, who despite being heavily afflicted with the Scarlet Rot and lacking an arm, is able to travel from Caelid all the way to the Haligtree almost on her own, requiring only some assistance from the player.\nThe items dropped by Invader Millicent in the Swamp of Aeonia may be a reference to other aspects of her lore: The 5 sacramental buds represent Millicent and her 4 sisters, while the rune items she drops are the same as the percentage damage increase of the base Winged Sword Insignia; 3, 5, and 10.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
