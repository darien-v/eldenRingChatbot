CONTEXT
\nElden Ring Map (Interactive): Find and track all Items, Bosses and Npcs in the game with our interactive map. Our Elden Ring Full Map is regularly updated with detailed information for all Quests, Equipment, Bosses and Locations, and much more! From Walking Mausoleums to special Teardrop Scarabs or NPC locations, you can find everything you need on this Elden Ring Map.\n\n Overland Checklist  Underground Checklist  Endgame Checklist\n\nElden Ring Map\n\nPlease be mindful that locations in the Elden Ring Map are not pixel-perfect to their corresponding location, as many items are found on top of each other. In order to provide easy tap targets for tooltips and links, some items have been spaced out around the area where they are found. Please see each description tooltip or item page for further details on the item, boss or location.\nElden Ring Map Size: this is a very big field, and users are working on figuring out the actual transformative distance of the Elden Ring Map in KM. You can find a 4k Elden Ring Map on our Maps section, that displays the full World Map divided by regions, featuring all locations and regional distinctions.\nThis Elden Ring Interactive Map is a still work in progress: You can contribute to it by editing wiki pages such as Locations to add information, and adding comments to this page to give tips and advise. You can also join us on discord.gg/fextralife to provide feedback and tips.\nIf you are on mobile, the map works best on Safari or Chrome. Allow it time to load in all the assets as you scroll or turn filters on or off. Alternatively we suggest using our static Maps instead, and the wiki's search function to find what you are looking for.\nHow to use the Elden Ring Map:\n\nClick the  sidebar icon of the map to see the map legend explaining the icons, and to swap between overworld and underground maps\nThe search bar matches partial words so you can try and put "sword" or "Staff" and see what comes up. Use the Weapons page and the categories there and in Armor to find names for items. Use the wiki search to find pages for "All Golden Seeds" etc.\nYou can filter by category using the checkmark layers on the right side of the map. These are general categories, so Upgrade materials include Flask upgrade items (Golden Seed, Sacred Tear), as well as Ore and Glovewort. Weapons category will include all weapon types, etc.\nPlease see our Walkthrough and Game Progress Route to figure out where to go!\nVIP USERS: PROGRESS TRACKER: Now live for ALL DEVICES!
