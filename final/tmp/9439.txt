The Serpentbone Blade scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for high Dexterity characters to engage in mid-range combat. It is capable of inflicting both Slash and Pierce attacks.\n\nSinister katana modeled after a serpent bone.\nThe densely packed row of spines that jut away from the cutting edge are coated in a lethal poison.\n\nWhere to Find Serpentbone Blade\nThe Serpentbone Blade weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nGiven as a reward for completing the second letter quest in Volcano Manor from Tanith. [Elden Ring Map here]\nVideo Location.\n\nSerpentbone Blade Notes & Tips\n\nWhen Poison is procced on an enemy using this weapon, the resulting poison effect will deal double the damage per tick but last a third of the amount of time compared to poison procced by other means. This is referenced as "Lethal Poison" in the weapons description, but "Deadly Poison" in other weapons/items. Overall, Deadly Poison will do less damage than regular poison if both are left for their full duration. (Fetid Pot and Venomous Fang also have the same effect) \n\nIts shortened duration can actually serve additional benefit; by reducing the uptime, it allows for more frequent triggers of certain damage boosting gear. The Mushroom Crown and the Kindred of Rot's Exultation can utilise this to great ends.\n\nWeapon Skill: Double Slash.\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War.\nSerpentbone Blade can be upgraded by using Smithing Stones.\nCauses Poison Buildup:  (66).\nCan't be enchanted with Magic nor boosted by Consumables.\nAt 80 Dex, this weapon has an AR of 598 (294+304) \n\nCompared to a Keen Uchigatana, which has an AR of 596 (258+337), the Serpentbone Blade has negligible higher damage, and deals more status effect (66 poison, vs 45 bleed).  Uchigatana maintains higher reach, but has lower base damage, so it only begins to outperform at higher levels.\n\nThis weapon has a unique R2 that consists of a double slash. \n\nThe initial hit of the R2 comes out exceptionally fast, but does limited damage, useful for staggering lower poise enemies who will then be hit by the higher damage second attack.\nCharging the attack causes your character to take a large step forward before delivering the double strike, making it a useful tool to close distance with dangerous enemies while still dealing considerable damage.\nBecause every weapons R2's normally counts as 2 hits towards "successive hits" talismans, AND this weapons R2 is a multi hit attack, this attack can make a single R2 allow you to gain 1 stack of all those talismans/items that boost the damage with successive attacks. (See examples below). This is because it takes a minimum of 3 hits to activate damage buff type "successive hits" talismans and one slash of the R2 counts as 2 hits while the one afterwards will count as a third hit. Whether the first or second slash counts as 2 hits is not known as of now.\nThe best setup to take advantage of the multi hit R2 is: Millicent's Prosthesis + Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or the regular version if you don't plan to go into ng+ or having it dropped by another player) + Kindred of Rot's Exultation (if you can proc poison)+ Shard of Alexander (since the Skill is also a multi hit) and then Thorny Cracked Tear for your Flask of Wondrous Physick. \n\nSell Value:   200\nDespite being locked to the Standard Affinity, it cannot be enhanced with Magic nor Consumables. It receives no Arcane scaling, yet has inherit Poison Buildup, and this amount cannot increase per upgrade level. The Ash of War cannot be changed. \nPatch 1.07 decreases the poise buildup for dual-wielded weapons, however, the poise damage when you two-handing Serpentbone Blade increased. Which affects the fighting style of builds like Serpent Samurai.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, Katanas poise damage has been reduced only on PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

QUESTION
Why is the Serpentbone Blade considered a good weapon for high Dexterity characters to engage in mid-range combat?

ANSWER
The Serpentbone Blade is considered a good weapon for high Dexterity characters to engage in mid-range combat due to its primary scaling with Strength and Dexterity, and its capability to inflict both Slash and Pierce attacks.
