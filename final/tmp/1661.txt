Elemer of the Briar is an extremely aggressive human boss and is found in The Shaded Castle in Altus Plateau. This is an optional boss as players don't need to defeat it to advance the plot of the game.  \nSee Bell Bearing Hunter for other variants of this boss.\n\n Elemer of the Briar, the Bell Bearing Hunter, snatched the sword from the site of his looming execution, and furnished it with battle skills from his home of Eochaid\n\nElden Ring Elemer of the Briar Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Shaded Castle Inner Gate\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Elemer of the Briar Location\nElemer of the Briar is at the very top of The Shaded Castle in Altus Plateau.  From the Shaded Castle Inner Gate Site of Grace, head north along the passage, turn west at the fork, and climb the ladder to a balcony with two Rotten Strays. Head east through the building, across the bridge, and into the next building. Climb the stairs and head south into another courtyard. Go into the door that a Cleanrot Knight emerges from, ride the elevator up, and head straight forward to find Elemer of the Briar.\n\nElemer of the Briar Combat information\n\nHealth: 4,897 HP \nDefense: 111\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes, but 2 parries are required per stance break\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nDamage: Standard, Strike, Pierce, Magic\nDrops 24,000\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 35\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 35\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 40\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 332 / 430 / 720 / 1177\nScarlet Rot: 332 / 430 / 720 / 1177\nHemorrhage: 543 / 833 / 1290\nFrostbite: 543 / 833 / 1290\n\nSleep: 332 / 430 / 720 / 1177\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs. The values after the "/"s indicate the increased resistances after each successive proc.\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n4,897\n7,154\n7,869\n8,227\n8,584\n9,300\n9,657\n10,015\n\nDefense\n111\n118\n121\n124\n129\n135\n141\n153\n\nRunes\n24,000\n72,000\n79,200\n81,000\n86,400\n88,200\n90,000\n91,800\n\n Resistances \n\nPoison\n332 / 430 / 720 / 1177\n358 / 456 / 746 / 1203\n363 / 461 / 751 / 1208\n368 / 466 / 756 / 1213\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n379 / 477 / 767 / 1224\n384 / 482 / 772 / 1229\n390 / 488 / 778 / 1235\n\nScarlet Rot\n332 / 430 / 720 / 1177\n358 / 456 / 746 / 1203\n363 / 461 / 751 / 1208\n368 / 466 / 756 / 1213\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n379 / 477 / 767 / 1224\n384 / 482 / 772 / 1229\n390 / 488 / 778 / 1235\n\nHemorrhage\n543 / 833 / 1290\n585 / 875 / 1332\n593 / 883 / 1340\n602 / 892 / 1349\n611 / 901 / 1358\n620 / 910 / 1367\n628 / 918 / 1375\n637 / 927 / 1384\n\nFrostbite\n543 / 833 / 1290\n585 / 875 / 1332\n593 / 883 / 1340\n602 / 892 / 1349\n611 / 901 / 1358\n620 / 910 / 1367\n628 / 918 / 1375\n637 / 927 / 1384\n\nSleep\n332 / 430 / 720 / 1177\n358 / 456 / 746 / 1203\n363 / 461 / 751 / 1208\n368 / 466 / 756 / 1213\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n379 / 477 / 767 / 1224\n384 / 482 / 772 / 1229\n390 / 488 / 778 / 1235\n\nMadness\nImmune\n\nElden Ring Elemer of the Briar Boss Guide\n\nElemer of the Briar Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nElemer of the Briar Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Elemer of the Briar:\n\nWhen entering the boss room, it's possible to sneak up behind him and hit him with a fully charged heavy attack. His retaliation to this will usually be a Shield Slam, allowing you to roll behind him and hit him again. Note that he cannot be back-stabbed.\nAll his sword attacks deal pure Physical Damage, so a shield with 100% physical negation can completely block them.\n\nMelee Users\nKeep it Close: Eochaid's Dancing Blade makes Elemer particularly effective at attacking you from medium or long distance, whereas he has relatively few moves and combos available at short range. Stay close and learn to dodge this limited and more predictable moveset. If you need to heal or use an item, wait until he uses Shield Slam, which has the longest recovery time in his arsenal. Remember you can bait it by moving directly behind him!\nBait and Strike: Move from close to medium range to provoke Elemer into using Eochaid's Dancing Blade, then close back in and attack. The first Dancing Blade attack can't combo into Blade Return, so you've got a relatively safe window as he passively retrieves the sword, especially if you stick to his right flank.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nUsing a Spirit Ash will help greatly with taking Elemer's attention, giving you a lot of time to deal damage. Keep your distance to avoid his quick melee attacks, but try to avoid getting too far away and provoking a Shield Charge which will quickly close the gap, and when his sword glows red get ready to dodge an Eochaid's Dancing Blade combo.\n\nElemer of the Briar Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwing\nSwings his sword in various directions. It may or may not glow red\nRoll away to bait Eochaid's Dancing Blade and close back in to do damage. This is almost always parriable, even when the sword is glowing red, but there's one exception. See the combo chart below\n\nStab\nStabs his sword straight ahead\nRoll to either side\n\nShield Charge\nDashes forward quickly, shield-first. Usually used when you're far away\nRoll to either side or stay close to avoid this attack in the first place\n\nShield Slam\nSlams his greatshield down to the ground, creating a small burst of damage. May follow up by pulling it back out, creating a larger damage burst. Often uses this when you're directly behind him\nMove backwards or roll backwards away to get out of the attack range, or roll diagonally forwards to end up behind him and punish the attack\n\nEochaid's Dancing Blade\nHis sword glows red and slashes at a distance. He'll usually start his Dancing Blade combos when you're at a medium or long distance away\nRoll forward. Although he can combo back into close-range attacks, it takes him long enough to retrieve his sword that this is a good opportunity to get in some damage. Just watch out for Blade Return\n\nBlade Return\nHolds out his right hand and calls back his sword quickly after Eochaid's Dancing Blade, stabbing the player in the back\nRoll to either side when you see him stretch out his right hand, or avoid positioning yourself directly between him and his sword in the first place\n\nDrillingBlade \nHolds his sword to his right as it begins to glow and spin, then thrusts it forward. This thrust can be either short- or long-range; if it's long-range, he'll follow it with an unparriable Swing.\nRoll to your left to avoid the attack and attack his unprotected side\n\nGrab\nHolds up his left hand as it glows red, then reaches forward to grab you. This attack has a deceptively long range. If you're grabbed, he'll lift you up and slam you down with his sword\nRun away from the boss as soon as you see his hand start glowing, or move to his back to get in a few hits.\n\nElemer of the Briar Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nElemer's sword originally belonged to House Marais, the family of executioners who presided over the Shaded Castle. Elemer snatched the sword from the site of his looming execution, and furnished it with battle skills from his home of Eochaid, which involve telekinetically moving their weapons.\nAfter beating this boss, the player can purchase his armor - Briar Set - from Enia.\nElemer also goes by the name of the Bell Bearing Hunter and has multiple other encounters around the Lands Between at night where other Shopkeeper NPCs are found.\n\nElemer of the Briar Combo Chart\n\nElemer of the Briar Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
