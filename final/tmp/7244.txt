They are tall, fully armoured, and are well-trained in combat, mastering the art of wielding different weaponry.\nThe spirits of two particular knights, Oleg and Engvall can be summoned for aid in battle using the Banished Knight Oleg and Banished Knight Engvall Ashes respectively.\n\n Many knights were sent to the fringes, where they were forced to start anew with only despair for company. These fierce warriors were each and all accomplished. Perhaps that is why, despite their territorial losses, they were still named knights.\n\nElden Ring Banished Knight Locations\nWhere to Find Banished Knights:\n\nMany knights can be found in Stormveil Castle wielding either a halberd or a greatsword and shield. All of them except two have the altered helm (without the red hood). \n\nOne can be found in a dark room, located at the top floor of the wine cellar in Stormveil Castle. You must use the side entrance that Gatekeeper Gostoc suggests in order to reach said room.\nA knight with a halberd patrols the room down the stairs from the Rampart Tower Site of Grace.\nA few can be found on top of the buildings in the center of Stormveil Castle.\nVideo Location\n\nTwo found with the unaltered helm (with a red hood) wielding a greatsword and shield, near the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in Caelid. One spawns inside near the grace and patrols around the outside of the cathedral. Another stands near the cliffs to the west.\nSpectral variants of Banished Knights appear in Castle Sol. In addition to the halberd and greatsword/shield-wielding knights, a dual greatsword variant can be found here. Like most spectral enemies, these knights can teleport and break your target lock.\n\nImmediately before Church of the Eclipse grace in Castle Sol will be a Banished Knight with a Greatsword + Shield, easily farmable as he can be backstabbed from when you leave the grace. (2824 HP)\n\nSeveral knights can be found in Crumbling Farum Azula, mostly patrolling the Dragon Temple area. Among these, a few will be the dual greatsword variant. They do not have the wind abilities, but they instead possess a flaming breath spell.\n\nElden Ring Banished Knight Combat information\n\nHealth: 742 - 3510 HP\nPoise: 65 - 75\nBanished Knights that cast Dragon Communion Incantations are\nDamage: Standard,  Strike, Pierce  \n\nBanished Knights wearing the altered helmet uses wind-based ashes of war in a form Stormcaller (all), Storm Stomp (shield) and Storm Assault (halberd)\nKnights wearing unaltered helmet may cast Dragonfire incantation dealing Fire damage. Those knights falls into   Dragon category.\n\nInflicts: Frostbite (Castle Sol)\nParryable: Yes, can be riposted afterwards\nCan be poise-broken and riposted.\nCan be backstabbed.\nNon-spectral knights are immune to Madness and Death Blight, spectral are immune to all status effects.\n\nAbsorptions\n\nPhy (Standard): 10 - 12\nPhy (Slash): 36 - 42\nPhy (Strike): 10 - 12\nPhy (Pierce): 0\n\nMagic: 20 - 24\nFire: 20 - 24\nLightning: (-47) - 0\nHoly: 20 - 24\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if an absorption is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 230 - 251\nScarlet Rot: 230 - 251\nHemorrhage: 316 - 346\nFrostbite: 316 - 346\nSleep: 230 - 251\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Banished Knight Drops\n 168 - 2193 Runes.\nNote that there are multiple variants of Banished Knights and they will only ever drop gear they are wearing on their model, a halberd wielding Banished Knight will never drop a greatsword or shield and vice versa, the unaltered helmet and chest piece can only be gotten from the variants wearing them and there is no variant that wears both at the same time.\n\n Item \n Drop Rate \n Additional Info \n\nRunes\n100%\n 168 - 3091\n\nBanished Knight Helm\n3.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight Helm (Altered)\n3.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight Armor\n3.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight Armor (Altered)\n3.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight Gauntlets\n3.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight Greaves\n3.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight's Greatsword\n4.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight's Halberd\n4.00%\nN/A\n\nBanished Knight's Shield\n4.00%\nN/A\n\nDragon Communion Seal\n100%\nGuaranteed drop from a Banished Knight inFringefolk Hero's Grave.\n\nBanished Knight Notes & Tips\n\nDue to their weakness to Lightning, Lightning-related items like Lightning Spear or Bolt of Gransax are recommended to eliminate them.\nCharging attack is the best opportunity for attack, as recovery after it gives more that enough time to perform backstab,\nFarming Tips: \n\nBanished Knight's Halberd and Banished Knight Set (with altered helm and altered chest armor) \n\nThe knight downstairs from the Rampart Tower grace in Stormveil Castle can be easily farmed. However, a +8 halberd also drops from Edgar, either by following his questline until his invasion at Revenger's Shack, or by killing him in earlier encounters.\n\nBanished Knight's Greatsword, Banished Knight's Shield, and Banished Knight Set (with unaltered helm and altered chest armor) \n\nThe knight at the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in Caelid is the easiest to farm. After resting at or traveling to the grace, go north to the doorway of the cathedral. The knight should have just started patrolling and can be backstabbed.\nThe knight past the birds at the Rampart Tower grace is also a great early game area to farm the Greatsword, yet a bit harder to farm than in Caelid.\n\nStormveil Castle farming route: \n\nTravel to "Rampart Tower" grace point in Stormveil Castle.\nPop a Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot if you have one.\nHead into the rampart tower and downstairs to your first Banished Knight (halberd). Defeat him by sneaking up or parrying or backstab fishing.\nHead back up to the hallway by the grace point.\nTake the lift directly across the hall from the entrance to the room with the point. Send it back up before you hop off.\nSprint through the room where the Grafted Scion was.\nTurn right and kill the three commoners and the sword Exile Soldier.\nHead up the stairs and kill the spear Exile Soldier.\nHead into the next room and kill the second Banished Knight (halberd). You should be able to sneak approach and backstab pretty easily.\nLeave out that room opposite the way you came in. Follow the path directly across the next room, through the breezeway, then veer left and straight ahead through another interior room. Make a right here and outside you'll see a Flame Spear guy in the distance. Approach and kill him.\nThis should aggro the 3rd Banished Knight (greatsword and shield). I usually shield and sidestep for a Backstab on this one. Or use a heavy spell to stagger.\nFast travel back to "Rampart Tower" and repeat.\n\nBanished Knight's Greatsword, Banished Knight Set (with altered helm and unaltered chest armor) \n\nThe red-eyed spectral Banished Knight on the castle wall of Castle Sol can be baited into teleporting onto a higher platform (the roof of a room), after which the player can jump or roll to the walkway atop the wall that the Banished Knight was standing on just before. Then the Banished Knight will slowly walk towards the player, at which point it will fall to its death, hopefully leaving the extremely rare unaltered Banished Knight Armor on the ground. The player can walk off the edge of the end of the walkway to safely fall to ground level, then make their way back to the loot, which will be in the corner, behind a tombstone.\nQuicker, but risker, method can be done from Castle Sol Rooftop (unlocked after beating boss of the arena). From the boss fight arena, player can make Banished Knight teleport with an arrow.\nAlternatively, from Church of the Eclipse site of grace go for ladder on the right of Banished Knight at the front of the Church.  Then turn left, go straight and go left. Eliminate wolfs first and then Banished Knight.\n\nIMAGE GALLERY\n\nElden Ring Creatures & Enemies\n\nAbductor Virgin  ♦  Abnormal Stone Cluster  ♦  Albinauric  ♦  Albinauric Wolfback Archer  ♦  Anastasia Tarnished-Eater  ♦  Ancestral Follower  ♦  Ancestral Follower Shaman  ♦  Avionette Soldier  ♦  Azula Beastman  ♦  Baleful Shadow  ♦  Basilisk  ♦  Battlemage  ♦  Bear  ♦  Blackflame Monk  ♦  Bloody Finger Nerijus  ♦  Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin  ♦  Boar  ♦  Broken Statue  ♦  Burning Slug  ♦  Celebrant  ♦  Chanting Winged Dame  ♦  Chariot  ♦  Chief Guardian Arghanthy  ♦  Clayman  ♦  Colossal Fingercreeper  ♦  Commoner  ♦  Construct  ♦  Crab  ♦  Crystal Snail  ♦  Crystal Sorcerer  ♦  Deer  ♦  Demi-Human  ♦  Demi-Human Queen  ♦  Depraved Perfumer  ♦  Direwolf  ♦  Dog  ♦  Duelist  ♦  Eagle  ♦  Edgar the Revenger  ♦  Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm  ♦  Exile Soldier  ♦  Fallen Hawks Soldier  ♦  Farum Azula Dragon  ♦  Festering Fingerprint Vyke  ♦  Fingercreeper  ♦  Fire Monk  ♦  Fire Prelate  ♦  Flame Guardian  ♦  Frenzied Villager  ♦  Giant Ant  ♦  Giant Bat  ♦  Giant Crab  ♦  Giant Crayfish  ♦  Giant Dog  ♦  Giant Dragonfly  ♦  Giant Land Octopus  ♦  Giant Land Squirt  ♦  Giant Miranda Sprout  ♦  Giant Rat  ♦  Giant Skeletal Slime  ♦  Giant Skeleton (Spirit)  ♦  Glintstone Dragon  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer  ♦  Godrick Foot Soldier  ♦  Golem  ♦  Great Horned Tragoth  ♦  Great-Jar Warrior  ♦  Guardian  ♦  Guillemot  ♦  Haligtree Foot Soldier  ♦  Haligtree Knight  ♦  Haligtree Soldier  ♦  High Page  ♦  Highwayman  ♦  Inaba, Disciple of Okina  ♦  Inquisitor Ghiza  ♦  Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood  ♦  Kaiden Sellsword  ♦  Knight of Zamor  ♦  Land Octopus  ♦  Land Squirt  ♦  Lazuli Sorcerer  ♦  Lesser Alabaster Lord  ♦  Lesser Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Lesser Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Lesser Burial Watchdog  ♦  Lesser Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Lesser Dragonkin Soldier (Spirit)  ♦  Lesser Fingercreeper  ♦  Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)  ♦  Lesser Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Lesser Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Lesser Omenkiller  ♦  Lesser Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Lesser Runebear  ♦  Lesser Sanguine Noble  ♦  Lesser Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Lesser Wormface  ♦  Leyndell Foot Soldier  ♦  Leyndell Knight  ♦  Leyndell Soldier  ♦  Lion Guardian  ♦  Living Jar  ♦  Lone Wolf  ♦  Mad Tongue Alberich  ♦  Maleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan  ♦  Malformed Star  ♦  Man-Serpent  ♦  Mausoleum Foot Soldier  ♦  Mausoleum Knight  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier  ♦  Miner  ♦  Miranda Sprout  ♦  Misbegotten  ♦  Monstrous Crow  ♦  Mounted Knight  ♦  Nameless White Mask  ♦  Night Maiden  ♦  Noble Sorcerer  ♦  Nomad  ♦  Nox Monk  ♦  Nox Swordstress  ♦  Old Knight Istvan  ♦  Omen  ♦  Oracle Envoy  ♦  Oracle Envoy Giant  ♦  Owl  ♦  Page  ♦  Preceptor Miriam  ♦  Putrid Avatar  ♦  Putrid Corpse  ♦  Radahn Foot Soldier  ♦  Radahn Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Foot Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Knight  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier  ♦  Recusant Henricus  ♦  Redmane Knight  ♦  Revenant  ♦  Rileigh the Idle  ♦  Rotten Duelist  ♦  Scarlet Rot Zombie  ♦  School of Graven Mages  ♦  Serpent Snail  ♦  Servant of Rot  ♦  Sheep  ♦  Silver Tear  ♦  Skeletal Bandit  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman  ♦  Skeletal Slime  ♦  Skeletal Snail  ♦  Skeleton Mage  ♦  Skeletons  ♦  Slug  ♦  Soldier  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish  ♦  Spirit NPC  ♦  Springhare  ♦  Starcaller  ♦  Tanith's Knight  ♦  Teardrop Scarab  ♦  Thorn Sorcerer  ♦  Troll  ♦  Troll Knight  ♦  Turtle  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer  ♦  Unobtainable Items  ♦  Vargram the Raging Wolf  ♦  Vulgar Militant  ♦  Wandering Nobles  ♦  Warhawk  ♦  Wild Mouflon  ♦  Wraith Caller\n\n

QUESTION
How can Banished Knights be efficiently farmed for their drops in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
In Stormveil Castle, use the Rampart Tower farming route for Banished Knight Halberd and Set; In Cathedral of Dragon Communion, farm the knight for Greatsword, Shield, and Set; In Castle Sol, bait the red-eyed spectral Banished Knight onto a higher platform for a chance to get an extremely rare unaltered Banished Knight Armor.
