CONTEXT
\n\n FP \n\nType\nBase Stat\n\nEffect\nEnergy consumed to use Spells and Skills.\n\nInfluenced by\nMind\n\nFP or Focus Points is one of the Stats in Elden Ring. Stats refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. FP is an energy resource that fuels your Spells and Skills. It is one of the Base Stats which are directly affected by a player's Main Attribute distribution. Stats such as FP are an important aspect of character progression in Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring FP Stat General Information\n\nFP or Focus Points is a Base Stat that serves as an energy resource consumed when casting Spells or using Skills. It works identically to MP or Mana in other titles.\nIn order to use Spells or Skills, you need to have as much or more FP as a spell or skill requires to use.\nFP is one of the most prevalent stats and is constantly displayed on the HUD, represented by a blue bar in the top left corner.\nResting at a Site of Grace fully replenishes your HP and FP. However, this also causes most enemies to respawn.\n\nHow to Increase Character FP in Elden Ring\n\nA player's Maximum FP can be increased intrinsically by adding points to Mind when leveling up.\nMind is one of the 8 Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on to level up.\nThe ability to level up is unlocked shortly after meeting Melina for the first time near the beginning of the game.\nLeveling up can be done at any Sites of Grace once unlocked.\nThe amount of Runes required to raise an Attribute increases with each character Level.\nRunes are obtained primarily by defeating Enemies and Bosses. Certain consumables such as the Fringefolk's Rune can also be used to gain a fixed number of runes.\nCertain Weapons, Armor or Talismans may also affect your maximum FP.\n\nFP-Related Items in Elden Ring\n\nThe following Consumables can be used to replenish/reduce FP consumption:\n\nFlask of Cerulean Tears\nFlask of Wondrous Physick (Mixed with Cerulean Crystal Tear and Cerulean Hidden Tear)\nStarlight Shards\n\nThe following Consumables consume FP to achieve certain effects:\n\nBaldachin's Blessing\nBewitching Branch\nBlood Grease\nGlintstone Scrap\nRoped Holy Water Pot\n\nFP-related Equipment in Elden Ring\nThe following Weapons, Armor and Talismans have an effect on FP and its consumption:\n\nCerulean Seed Talisman\nBoosts FP restoration from Flask of Cerulean Tears\n   0.8\n\nIt can be found in the rafters of the Carian Study Hall next to a body.\n\nCerulean Amber Medallion\nRaises maximum FP\n   0.3\n\nRegular variant: Lakeside Crystal Cave after defeating the Bloodhound Knight.\n+1 Variant: Castle Sol: Found on a corpse hanging by a wooden ledge above the southern walls of the castle.
