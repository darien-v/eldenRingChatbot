This is an optional boss as players don't need to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring, though they do need to defeat it to advance further in Raya Lucaria Academy and to achieve a certain ending.\nLesser Red Wolf of Radagon is the normal enemy form of this boss. Red Wolf of the Champion is another variant of this boss.\n\nElden Ring Red Wolf of Radagon Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss, but is required to reach Rennala Queen of the Full Moon and thus being able to respec.\nClosest Site of Grace: Schoolhouse Classroom\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: Sorceress Sellen can be summoned for this boss fight after completing most of her questline.\n\nElden Ring Red Wolf of Radagon Location\nHead out the door south of the Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace and along the corridor past several Glintstone Sorcerers.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 324 / 422 / 712 / 1169\nScarlet Rot: 324 / 422 / 712 / 1169\nHemorrhage: 530 / 820 / 1277\nFrostbite: 530 / 820 / 1277\n\nSleep: 324 / 422 / 712 / 1169\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

Wait for attacks with long recovery times like Rearing Bite, Blade Plunge, and Glintstone Cometshard, nail the dodges, and get in only as many hits as you can afford before going back on the defensive. Experiment to figure out whether your weapon deals more damage with a few quick hits or one charged heavy attack. Don't bother attacking if there are Magic Glintblades active, or you're likely to take more damage than you inflict.\nTurtle Up: All of the Red Wolf's melee attacks deal Physical damage, so if you're good at stamina management you can get a lot of mileage out of a shield with 100% Physical reduction. Try to keep your shield up as often as possible as long as you've got the stamina for it, since its Bite attacks can come out of nowhere and cover a surprising amount of distance. Check the combo chart to see when it's safe to get in a guard counter and try to build towards breaking its considerable stance.\n\nMagic and Ranged Users\nBaby in a Corner: The Red Wolf will usually dodge ranged attacks, so try to maneuver it into a corner to limit its range of motion. Take advantage of the windups for its attacks to get in hits, but be ready to dodge those attacks as soon as you're done casting.\nMagical Melee: Ignore its ranged dodges entirely by using close-range spells rather than projectiles. Follow one of the melee strategies, but instead of attacking with physical weapons use spells like Carian Slicer or Catch Flame. Weapons that deal physical damage but scale on Intelligence and Faith, like Rosus' Axe or Winged Scythe, are even more effective due to the Red Wolf's high elemental resistance.\n\nRed Wolf of Radagon Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nBite\nSteps forward and bites at the player\nRoll forward, step back, or guard\n\nRearing Bite\nRears up on its hind legs, then plunges its head down and forward while biting\nRoll forward and attack during its long recovery\n\nLeaping Bite\nLeaps forward and bites, then lands on the other side of the player and pivots 180° to face them\nRoll forward as its head starts to descend\n\nGolden Blade\nSummons a magical golden sword and swings it in wide arcs\nRoll in the direction the blade is swinging or guard. This deals Standard damage, so it can also be safely blocked with a shield with 100 Physical reduction. Some variations of this attack have very long windups, giving players plenty of time to back away\n\nBlade Plunge\nSummons its sword, leaps high into the air in a corkscrew motion, then slams the sword down on the ground\nRoll forward as it begins to fall and get in a hit during the long recovery\n\nMagic Glintblade\nMoves a short distance left or right, creating a magical orb as it goes. Shortly afterwards, this orb fires a single magical glintblade at you\nKeep moving to the side and the glintblade will miss you, so focus on dodging until it's gone\n\nGlintblade Dash\nDashes to the left or right, leaving three Magic Glintblades as it goes\nAs above, just keep moving until all the glintblades have fired and missed. It will keep attacking you after they're created, so focus on evading until you're no longer under double threat\n\nGlintstone Cometshard\nJumps into the air and shoots a large magical projectile\nRun forward when you see it jump and you can run underneath the cometshard and attack after it lands, or else roll forward when it's at the apex of its jump\n\n: Attack can be spell parried\nRed Wolf of Radagon Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nRed Wolf of Radagon is heavily inspired by an unused concept for a boss fight concept from Dark Souls 3 related to Old Wolf of Farron\nFollows a trend of large wolf bosses in Souls games, Great Grey Wolf Sif and Gravetender Greatwolf\nBug: If wolf lands on globe above him and try to jump back on the field of battle, it will die due to gravity fall.\n\nRed Wolf of Radagon Combo Chart\n\nRed Wolf of Radagon Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
