The Full Moon Crossbow requires primarily Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence, and serves as a good Weapon for ranged attacks imbued with magic.\n\nOne-of-a-kind enchanted crossbow of exquisitely detailed craftsmanship. Made to celebrate the matrimonial union, and reconciliation, between the houses of the Erdtree and the Full Moon, Leyndell and Raya Lucaria. The two rings dance when reloading the weapon. Reveals true worth when used with holy-infused bolts.\n\nWhere to Find Full Moon Crossbow in Elden Ring\nThe Full Moon Crossbow weapon can be found in a bell tower, along the Raya Lucaria Academy rooftops. [Map Link]\n\nFirst, head to the area with the rooftops: \n\nFrom the Debate Parlor Site of Grace, head out into the courtyard to the north. Go up the destroyed staircase to the northwest and then up another set of stairs northward to where the two sorcerers are. Jump over the railing to the west. Go up the stairs and around the corner. Jump over the railing to the south to land on some rooftops.\n\nAfter reaching the rooftops, climb up the ladder on a building to the southwest to reach a bridge with a Glintstone Sorcerer and three Avionette Soldiers. Behind them is a bell tower where the chest containing the Full Moon Crossbow is located.\nThe entrance to the bell tower is on a lower level which requires taking a path around on the rooftops. First, go past the bell tower and drop down two levels. From there, perform a running jump across a gap to reach another section of rooftops to the west.\nAfter making the jump, follow the roofs south past the Marionette Soldiers to enter the bell tower. Climb up the ladder inside to find a chest with the Full Moon Crossbow. \n\nVideo Location\n\nElden Ring Full Moon Crossbow Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Kick\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nThis weapon cannot be enchanted with Magic or boosted with Consumables\nSell Value:   500\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
