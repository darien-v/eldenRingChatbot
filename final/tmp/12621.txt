CONTEXT
\nTalismans in Elden Ring are accessories that bestow a variety of special effects. They're dropped by Enemies or Bosses, looted from chests, pilfered from corpses, or purchased from Merchants.\nTalismans cannot be upgraded; however, more powerful versions of some talismans are obtainable. They're often recognizable by their bolster text (e.g. Talisman Name +1), with exceptions such as the Great-Jar's Arsenal (a direct upgrade to the Arsenal Charm).\nTalismans are allowed in Player Trade.\n\nIncreasing Talisman Slots in Elden Ring\nObtaining Talisman Pouches increases the number of talisman equip slots.
