Shardbearers drop their own unique Great Rune and Remembrance capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, Ashes of War, and Talismans for the player.\nGodrick the Grafted is the ruler of Stormveil Castle, and is one of the first demigods and shardbearers that players can fight. He is a descendant of Godfrey and thus born of the golden lineage, but Gideon and Kenneth Haight believe him to be weak and unworthy to rule. Much of Godrick's power comes from the arms and legs of soldiers he's grafted onto himself, and especially the dragon head grafted onto his left arm during the second phase of his fight. His knights and soldiers wear armor that bears emblems of the golden lineage: a two-headed war-axe and the beast regent, Serosh.\nGodrick is an optional boss, and doesn't need to be defeated in order to advance in Elden Ring. You can advance to Liurnia of the Lakes without defeating him by following the path north from Stormhill Shack, then dropping down to the west from the broken bridge and walking along the outside of the castle. However, Godrick is a shardbearer, and two of the five available shardbearers must be defeated before entering Leyndell, Royal Capital.\n\n I command thee, kneel!\nI am the lord of all that is golden!\n\nElden Ring Godrick the Grafted Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Secluded Cell\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: Nepheli Loux. Exhaust her dialog in her room between the Liftside Chamber and Secluded Cell Sites of Grace, and her summon sign will appear just outside the boss door\n\nWhere to find Godrick the Grafted in Elden Ring\nGodrick the Grafted can be found at the end of Stormveil Castle. [Map link]\nGodrick the Grafted Combat information\n\nHealth: 6,080 HP \nDefense: 105\nStance: 105\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\nHas increased defense during phase transition\nHis Stormcaller attack deflects throwable items like arrows and pots.\nDamage: Standard,  Strike (phase 1) Standard, Fire,  Strike (phase 2)\nDrops 20,000, Godrick's Great Rune, Remembrance of the Grafted\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 0\nSlash: 0\nStrike: 0\nPierce: 0\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 318 / 416 / 706 / 1163\nScarlet Rot: 318 / 416 / 706 / 1163\nHemorrhage: 318 / 416 / 706 / 1163\nFrostbite: 318 / 416 / 706 / 1163\n\nSleep: 318 / 416 / 706 / 1163\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

Just be careful to always return to the open center so you don't get cornered yourself.\nGodrick is weaker to physical damage than elemental damage. Rock Sling is a good option for Intelligence builds, while Faith builds can use Bestial Sling\nWhen using fist-type weapon, aim for sides of Godrick or perform jump attacks, as hitbox may not connect if hits are for the front.\nRotten Stray ashes are very good against him, as the Scarlet Rot that the dog inflicts is boosted over other rot sources such as Rotten Breath.\n\nMelee Users\nBide Your Time: The safest (but slowest) strategy for Godrick is to stay outside the range of his weaponry as much as possible, and only try to get in damage when he does one of his many punishable attacks. Stormcaller is best for this: when he starts spinning up a cyclone, get close enough to tempt him into a Storm Assault, then run behind him and get in a few hits until he recovers. Axe Lunge, Jumping Slam, and the fifth attack in Fury Swings also have long recovery times that you can punish. Once you get to phase 2, you'll also be able to punish all of his fire-breathing attacks as long as you stay close enough to get to his side before you get roasted. This strategy is particularly good for heavy weapons, which can use jump attacks or charged heavy attacks to build up Stance damage and get in critical hits.\nStick Close: A riskier but quicker strategy is to stay right up next to him. This will limit how many different attacks he does, but also means you'll need to learn the precise timings to dodge or block the remainder. But once you learn those timings, you can get in hits during the frequent delays while he's winding up attacks, as well as jump attacks when he uses Lesser Command in phase 1 and I Command Thee, Kneel! in phase 2. This strategy is particularly good for weapons that inflict status effects, since it'll let you get in more frequent quick attacks.\n\nMagic and Ranged Users\nDistraction: Summons are very useful to distract Godrick, but he hits hard so it's important to choose a summon that can survive his assault. Spirit Jellyfish Ashes is a good option due to its high defense and immunity to shockwaves. While your summons keep Godrick from rushing you down, you can attack him from afar. Once he notices you, keep backing off until your summons catch his attention again.\nCircle and Strafe: Keep moving as much as you can. Try to stay towards his sides and back, out of his line of sight, and start casting or firing as he's finishing his attacks so that you can start moving again once he's back in action. Remember that running is often quicker and more stamina-efficient than rolling when evading his attacks with long windups that cover a lot of area.\n\nAttacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nAxe Swing\nSwings his axe in various directions. There's sometimes a long delay between when he raises his axe and when he actually swings it\nRoll out of the way or block with a shield. Because of the frequent delays, try to only start rolling when you see the axe begin to move towards you. If you learn which attacks have a long delay, you can get in a cheeky hit before he swings\n\nArm Swing\nSwings his left arm in various directions. In phase 2, his arm will have a dragon head, giving it substantially more reach and damage\nRoll out of the way or block with a shield\n\nAxe Lunge\nPulls his axe back, then thrusts it a long way forward into the ground\nRoll to the side when you see his feet leave the ground\n\nRoll\nRolls to the side and immediately readies another attack. The roll itself doesn't do any damage, but it will allow Godrick to quickly reposition himself\nMove away from the direction of the roll to avoid getting caught by the follow-up\n\nDragging Slash\nDrags his axe along the ground to his right, creating sparks, then slashes it forward\nRoll to his left when you see the dragging start to avoid getting hit by the slash\n\nJumping Slam\nHolds his axe sideways with both hands, then jumps into the air and slams down to the ground\nMove away when you see him grab the axe, or roll when you see him begin to fall\n\nLesser Command\nRaises his axe with the head pointing down, slams it into the ground creating a large shockwave, then pushes it down again after a brief delay creating another shockwave\nThe easiest option is to run away when you see him raising his axe to begin this move. However, if you start jumping when you see the axe start falling and again when you see his shoulders rise, you can get in some extra damage with jump attacks\n\nFury Swings\nHolds his axe in front of his face, draws it back, then swings it five times: first counterclockwise, then quickly clockwise, then counterclockwise upwards, then twice downwards\nEither run away during the windup, or dodge each swing and use the long delays after the last four to hit him in between. If you do the latter, make sure to count the swings so you know when they'll be fast and when they'll be slow\n\nStormcaller\nSwings his axe around in circles, surrounding himself with a cyclone that reflects projectiles and knocks back the player. This attack and its followups are imbued with flame during phase 2\nBack away as soon as you see his axe start to lift and prepare for the follow-up move. Don't use projectiles during this attack, since they'll just bounce off.\n\nStorm Assault\nRolls once to the sides before leaping into the air and swinging his axe counterclockwise as he descends.\nRun behind him while he's in the air and get in a few hits while he swings and recovers\n\nStorm Blade\nDigs his axe into the ground, then pulls it out shooting out blasts of wind that curve towards your position.\nWait for the attack to turn, then move in the opposite direction to make sure it doesn't hit you\n\nSever Arm\nOnce Godrick hits 60% health or less, he'll chop off his own arm, initiating a cutscene. You can get hurt if you're near him. He'll gain increased defense during this.\nDespite the damage reduction, this attack is a safe opportunity to get in some extra hits, as long as you stay away from his arm. Take this opportunity to build up statuses like Bleed.\n\nPhase 2\n\nSweeping Flame\nHis dragon arm breathes a long stream of fire, sweeping the area in front of him. He will always use this attack in the beginning of Phase 2.\nThe fire has very long range, but his back and sides are completely unprotected during this attack. Run up beside him and get in some hits. If you have to dodge through the stream of fire, do so as close to the mouth of the dragon as possible so the stream is at its narrowest\n\nStriding Flame\nHis dragon arm breathes fire in a straight line as he walks forward.\nRun to his sides and get in a few hits, but be aware that the flame can sometimes persist behind him as he walks\n\nGrab\nHis dragon head opens its mouth and then lunges at you after a brief delay. If it connects, he'll grab you, then slam you on the ground while breathing fire.\nRoll forward or to the left when you hear the dragon roar, or when you see its head opening its mouth.\n\nI Command Thee, Kneel!\nRaises the axe with its head pointing down, then slams it into the ground twice in quick succession creating small shockwaves, then once more after a second's pause creating a much larger shockwave\nAs for Lesser Command, running away is the easiest strategy. It's risky to go for jump attacks the first two hits because they're so quick, but you can jump the third one as his foot touches the ground and the axes begin to descend\n\nBear Witness!\nPlunges his dragon arm into the ground, drags it in a circle around him, then thrusts it upwards, raining fire in front of him\nRun behind him while he's twirling around, but be careful of getting too close since the dragon head will hurt if it hits you\n\nElden Ring Godrick the Grafted Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Ramon Tikaram\nSoundtrack: Godrick the Grafted\nGodrick is a descendent of Godfrey, and thus a member of the Golden Lineage. He is possibly the son of Godwyn, due to his heritage and the fact that Mohg and Morgott were Omen.\nEnia describes Godrick as the weakest of the demigods, which is alluded to when he was driven from the capital and was defeated by Stance damage when he's at 60% health or below, so you can also prevent it by exclusively using spells like Poison Mist that reduce HP without affecting Stance.\nCut content suggested that Gostoc is the son of Godrick, and was thus an elligible ruler of Stormveil and Limgrave. Another had Godrick reciting a speech about his forces returning to their home, bathed in rays of gold.\nGame-wise, this boss is treated as 1 encounter instead of 2 as it is more common in case of bosses where phases are separated by cutscene \n\nAlso, phase transition seems to not reset Poison and Scarlet Rot if it is inflicted\n\nDialogue\nIntroduction:\nMighty Dragon, thou'rt a trueborn heir. \nLend me thy strength, o kindred. \nDeliver me unto greater heights.\n...Well. \nA lowly Tarnished, \nplaying as a lord.\nI command thee, kneel! \nI am the lord of all that is golden!\nDuring Fight (Phase 1):\nDefeating player: Lowly Tarnished... Thou'rt unfit even to graft...\nSecond Phase Transition:\nAhh, truest of dragons. \nLend me thy strength… \nNnngh! \nForefathers, one and all… \nBear witness!\nDuring Fight (Phase 2):\nDefeating player: Great Godfrey, did'st thou witness?\nAfter Fight:\n...I am Lord of all that is Golden....\n...And one day, we'll return together...\n...To our home, bathed in rays of gold...\n\nGodrick the Grafted Combo Chart\n\nImage Gallery for Godrick the Grafted in Elden Ring\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
