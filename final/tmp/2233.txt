CONTEXT
\n\n Strike Damage \n\nCategory\nPhysical Damage\n\nStrike Damage is one of the Damage Types in Elden Ring. It is one of the eight main Damage Types and belongs to the Physical Damage category. Damage Types are a major part of the calculation that determines how much damage is dealt in Combat and are affected by many factors including your equipment, skills, attacks and temporary buffs.\n\nElden Ring Strike Damage Guide\nStrike Damage is a type of Physical Damage that is often associated with blunt weapons such as Hammers and Maces. Weapons that primarily deal the other damage
