And I can also see... That you're not after my throat. Then why not purchase a little something? I am Kale, Purveyor of fine goods.\n\nAbout Kale\n\nI am of a nomadic people. Selling wares as I travel. The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring. It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely. Let's say you're a very welcome customer.\n\nRecommendation\n\nYou know, if you can spare the runes, you should buy yourself a crafting kit. A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own. Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration. The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut. But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.\nI'm glady you took my warning to heart. You've made an excellent choice. (after you buy the recommendation)\n\nSmall Talk\n\nThere are other of my peoples who yet survive in these lands. If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you? My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold. Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey. But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered. I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.\nPerhaps you don't need to hear this, but... See that no harm comes to my kin. We have a saying, we wanderers. Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing. But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy. That is our code, so to speak. Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.\n\nHowling in the Mistwood\n\n"The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood...I suppose he must still be skulking about...Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself? Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source. Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear. I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off. "\n\n§About Blaidd\n\n"Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you? Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction. He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg. I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another."\n\nWhen attacked\n\nI knew you for a highwayman all along. Then it's time you learnt a lesson. Our people will not stand for your barbarism!\n(On player kill) Is that all you were, mate?\n\nWhen Killed\n\nIs this... how it ends? I'll never find...\n\nOther\n\nWait, weren't you? Well, you're back... Care to buy something?\nWhat is it? Still going to purchase something?\nGood-bye, for now.\nGoody-bye. Nice to do bussiness.\n\nElden Ring Notes & Trivia for Merchant Kalé\nWhere is Kale in Elden Ring?\nMerchant Kale can be found in the  Church of Elleh in Limgrave.
