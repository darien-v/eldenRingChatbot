CONTEXT
\nKeepsakes in Elden Ring are optional pieces of equipment available to the player at Character Creation, granting additional strength at the start of one's journey. There are nine Keepsakes to choose from, but players may opt to start the game without one. This page covers their names, descriptions, usages, and recommendations for which to take.\nAll Keepsakes are obtainable later in the game, some near immediately, meaning that you can safely make your choice for the early-game.\n\nElden Ring Keepsakes\n\nName\nDescription\nUsage\n\n  None \nNo keepsake.

Below are reasons for taking some of the more popular among them:\n\n  Lands Between Rune - An instant  3000 Runes. Allows for early level-ups or Merchant purchases. \n  Golden Seed - Grants an additional charge for your Sacred Flasks, providing extra HP or FP restoration. \n  Fanged Imp Ashes - A duo of Fanged Imps that can deal significant damage to high health targets using attacks which inflict Blood Loss. \n  Stonesword Key - Gain early access to areas gated by imp statues. These keys are readily purchasable, but at a starting price of  2000 Runes. \n\nNot Recommended Keepsakes in Elden Ring\nWhile Keepsakes will not have a significant impact on your overall experience, below are reasons why some fall short of a recommendation:\n\n  Crimson Amber Medallion - Relatively minor health increase. Readily purchasable for  1500 Runes. \n  Cracked Pot - Used to craft throwing pots, but requires Cookbooks for greater variety and collecting Materials for consistent use. Three are readily purchasable for  300 Runes each. \n  Bewitching Branch - Inconsistent against different types of enemies, and limited quantity. \n  Boiled Prawn - Fair damage negation and duration, but their limited quantity can make players hesitant to use them at the right time, if at all. \n  Shabriri's Woe - Generating enmity can be situationally powerful. However, its strengths are better explored when players are more familiar with the available summons and Spirit Ashes. \n\n
