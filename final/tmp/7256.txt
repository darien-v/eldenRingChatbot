The Erdtree Greatshield is a Shield that scales primarily with Strength and Faith. Greatshields weigh a decent amount and provide the best protection in the game. Greatshields provide a greater value of blocking and protecting one's self from enemy and boss attacks, but greatly increases the weight and reduces the player's mobility. This type of shield works best at reducing damage or guarding instead of parrying.\n\nWeighty greatshield forged of gold carried by the order of Tree Sentinels, heavily equipped knights. Blessed by an old incantation of protection.The living rampart of the Erdtree, the Tree Sentinels are the standard to which all defenders of the Erdtree aspire.\n\nWhere to Find Elden Ring Erdtree Greatshield\nThe Erdtree Greatshield Shield can be found at the following location:\n\nCan be acquired by Killing Tree Sentinel Duo. [Elden Ring Map here]\nTree Sentinel Duo is a Foe Boss found in Altus Plateau, guarding the doors to the the Outer Wall Phantom Tree grace. You must defeat both Tree Sentinels to earn this shield.\n\nElden Ring Erdtree Greatshield Notes & Tips\n\nShield Skill: Golden Retaliation\nSkill Description: Ready the shield to unleash its protective incantation. This will dispel sorceries and incantations, retaliating with golden power. \n\nThe active parry window is shorter than the animation that accompanies the ash of war. Try to press L2 so that the spell strikes right after you lift up the shield.\nDue to recovery frames it is difficult to parry multiple spells cast by the same source. During PvP spells such as Glintstone Pebble and others with a similar cast-speed will likely give too little spacing between them to parry multiple spells in a row.\nAsh of War damage scales with weapon upgrade level and marginally with the player's Faith, but not with any other stats.\nThe projectile deals reduced damage the farther it travels due to severe damage dropoff, but the Arrow's Reach Talisman can alleviate this. (In this case, the talisman only reduces the damage dropoff penalty, leaving the actual range of the projectile unchanged.) \nSpells cast by the player can also be parried with Golden Retaliation provided they hit the shield. For example, the spell Discus of Light can be parried when it returns to the player, and the wraiths summoned by the Wraith Calling Bell can be parried as well by walking slightly forward before it floats towards its target. This allows the Ash of War to be used against any enemy rather than only casters.\n\nThis shield cannot be infused with Ashes of War.\nSell Value: 500\nVersion 1.03 onwards: No longer activates when player is afflicted with damage over time.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below.\n\nErdtree Greatshield PvP Poise Damage Values in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations.
