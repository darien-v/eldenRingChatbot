The Ornamental Straight Sword scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for melee combat, especially when accompanied with the skill, Golden Tempering, which allows users to deal dual-wielding combo with a strong attack while in effect.  The Ornamental Straight Sword is one of a few non-Claw/Fist Paired Weapons.\n\nSlender straight sword patterned after an antique ornament.Superior swordsmen prefer to wield one in each hand.\nAfter falling from grace, the dregs of the golden lineage sought power and purpose in the past.\n\nWhere to Find Ornamental Straight Sword in Elden Ring\nThe Ornamental Straight Sword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nDropped by the Grafted Scion at the Chapel of Anticipation. Players can return to this area after tutorial by using the waygate at The Four Belfries.  [Elden Ring Map here]\n\nElden Ring Ornamental Straight Sword Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Golden Tempering\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War.\nCannot be enchanted with Magic nor boosted with Consumables.\nOrnamental Straight Sword can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nThis is a paired weapon, and two-handing it allows you to dual wield two of the swords at once.  Two handing the weapon does NOT confer the typical 1.5x STR multiplier that would be typical of two handing weapons.\nAt +10 upgrade level, 80 Dex, 10 Str, this weapon has an AR of 482 (247+237)\nThe dual-wield of this weapon functions somewhat differently to most powerstanced weapons, and as a result, you have access to a complete set of dual weapon attacks, since most weapons only double attack with the L1 button.   \n\nFor Example: The jumping R1 attack is the thrusting sword powerstance jumping attack, comprised of a series of fast thrusts and slashes in an area directly in front of the user.  Useful for triggering multi-hitting talisman\n\nOne of the lightest physical weapons that equips a weapon in each hand, which is excellent when paired with the Blue Dancer Charm.  Only fist/claw weapons can compare for weight, but they lack the range that the OSS provides. That being said, the Blue Dancer Charm only buffs physical damage, so it has no effect on the 100 conferred Holy Damage from Golden tempering. \n\nThe minimum weapon weight would be 1.5, on the Caestus, so you only give up 1.5 weight for a massive range buff\n\nSell Value:   200\nWith consecutive attack buffs such as the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia/Millicent's Prosthesis combo and Thorny Cracked Tear, as well as charged R2 attack buffs like the Axe Talisman and Spiked Cracked Tear, you can get some insane numbers.\nIt is possible to perform the paired weapon charged R2 even when one-handing this weapn while Golden Tempering is active. Because of this, you can two-hand this weapon, apply Golden Tempering, then one-hand it and buff yourself with the Jellyfish Shield skill Contagious Fury. Performing the charged heavy attack will not cancel Contaigous Fury, which is normally cancelled as soon as the Jellyfish Shield is stowed away for two-handing another weapon.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, Straight Swords poise damage has been reduced only on PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below. Additionally, the running attack speed, first attack speed and speed of guard counter of straight sword has increased. The attack recovery time has also decreased.\nWhen performing the Golden Tempering skill, the "Erdtree & Crucible" symbol will flash shortly. This symbol is otherwise only found in three places in the lands between (two, technically): On the ground in the Chapel of Anticipation, directly beneath where the Grafted Scion who drops this weapon lands to fight the player at the beginning of the game, and in the middle of the Roundtable in the Fortified Manor [Map Link] (and thus by extension the Roundtable Hold), mostly obscured by the gigantic axe and the numerous swords plunged into the symbol. \n\nThe description of this weapon reads: "After falling from grace, the dregs of the golden lineage sought power and purpose in the past." So the implication here is that 1: The Golden Lineage is connected to the Primordial Crucible very directly (further supported by the Crucible Knights who fought for Godfrey). And 2: the Primordial Crucible of the Erdtree was one of, if not the inspiration for Godrick's practice of grafting, as it too melds all forms of life together, and thus the Crucible represents the "past" in this weapons description. And 3: The Roundtable and Fortified Manor are connected to the Crucible and the Golden Lineage as they only other places with this symbol in the game.\n\nOther notes and player tips go here.\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Ornamental Straight Sword\nOne-handed moveset:\n\nLight Attack is a 4-hit combo of diagonal and horizontal strikes ending in a diagonal downwards slash from right to left\nStrong Attack is a thrust, followed by an uppercut slash on the second input\n\nWhen buffed with its unique weapon skill, Strong Attack is an upward thrust with both swords \n\nCharge Attack is identical to Strong Attack\n\nWhen buffed with its unique weapon skill, Charge Attack is a combo of 8 thrusts, ending with an upward thrust with both swords\n\nRunning Light Attack is a horizontal slash from left to right\nRunning Strong Attack is a downward slam\nBackstep Light Attack is a diagonal slash from left to right\nRolling Attack is a thrust \nJumping Light Attack is a horizontal slash from right to left\nJumping Strong Attack is a downward slam\n\nTwo-handed moveset:\n\nLight Attack is a cross slash with both weapons, followed by a dual horizontal slash, followed by two staggered thrusts, ending with a diagonal downward slash from left to right\nStrong Attack is a thrust, followed by an uppercut slash on the second input \n\nWhen buffed with its unique weapon skill, Strong Attack is an upward thrust with both swords\n\nCharge Attack is identical to Strong Attack\n\nWhen buffed with its unique weapon skill, Charge Attack is a combo of 8 thrusts, ending with an upward thrust with both swords\n\nRunning Light Attack is a is a thrust with the left sword, followed by a slash with the right sword\nRunning Strong Attack is a thrust with both swords\nBackstep Light Attack is a thrust with both swords\nRolling Attack is a a horizontal sweep from left to right with both swords\nJumping Light Attack is a quick 3-hit combo of two thrusts and a slash\nJumping Strong Attack is a cross slash with both weapons\n\nLeft-handed and power-stance moveset:\n\nLeft-handed Light Attack is a 5-hit combo ending in a downwards slash\nNo rolling, backstep, running or jumping attacks exist in the left-handed moveset\nPower-stance Light Attack is a cross slash with both weapons, followed by a dual horizontal slash, followed by two staggered thrusts, ending with a diagonal downward slash from left to right\nPower-stance Running Attack is a thrust with the left weapon, followed by a slash with the right weapon\nPower-stance Backstep Attack  is a thrust with both weapons\nPower-stance Rolling Attack is a horizontal sweep from left to right with both weapons\nPower-stance Jumping Attack  is a cross slash with both weapons\n\nMounted moveset:\n\nLight Attack is a three-hit combo of up-and-down slashes\nStrong Attack is a single uppercut slash\nCharge Attack holds the sword close to the ground, dealing continuous damage, and ends with an uppercut slash\n\nStraight Swords Showcase\n\nGolden Champion Written Guide\n\nOrnamental Straight Sword PvP Poise Damage in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations.
