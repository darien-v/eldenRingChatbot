The Torchpole scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity, and is a decent Weapon for inflicting fire-based attacks from far away.\n\nTorch fastened to a long pole. Lights up dark areas, but cannot beraised overhead.\nUsed by soldiers on watch, its attacks set foes aflame.\n\nWhere to Find Torchpole in Elden Ring\nThe Torchpole weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nPlayers can obtain the Torchpole by killing the Stormveil Castle courtyard guards. [Elden Ring Map here] \n\nOne enemy dropping this weapon can be found close to Stormveil Cliffside Site of Grace, just up the wooden stairs along the wall. Although tempting, it is not recommended that you use projectile weapons/ranged attacks from the Site of Grace to kill this enemy from afar, as upon death the soldier may fall off the edge.\nThere are three torchpole carriers in the courtyard near the Liftside Chamber site of grace. Head east from the grace and there will be one almost due south as you head down the first stairway, and another southeast; both standing on ramparts. The third is up the wooden stairway to the east.\n\nElden Ring Torchpole Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Charge Forth\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War nor buffed with Magic or Consumables.\nTorchpole can be upgraded by using Smithing Stones.\nSell Value:   100\nBase drop rate is 2% (at 100 Discovery).\nPros: really long range among its class. The third longest spear (not including great spears) behind the pike. The range is definitely noticeable, and helps keep you out of attack range much easier than other spears, though obviously not as well as the pike. That range also compliments Charge Forth very well, making it much easier to land (and avoid attacks during) than with shorter weapons. Gives off light, making it great for caves. The fire damage is very low, but proves super useful for any enemy that gets put into a special on-fire stun animation, like dogs and (especially) finger creepers.\nCons: No infusing, no buffing. Locked scaling at the lower end of C (both Str and Dex are equal within C), and only scaling on the physical attacks. Paired with unimpressive base damage, and this thing's damage will be far outpaced by other spears that can utilize ashes and buffs. 2nd worst stamina damage in class, for seemingly no reason; most normal-sized spears max at 80, but this only gets up to 72, even though it weighs more than many of the others... quite counter-intuitive. No changing the skill off of Charge Forth. Charge Forth is a good skill, and definitely something people sleep on, but it adds very little to this weapons kit. \nNote: As of Patch 1.08, poise damage of all Spears has been reduced for PVP. \nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

QUESTION
Why is the Torchpole weapon in Elden Ring recommended for inflicting fire-based attacks from far away?

ANSWER
The Torchpole weapon in Elden Ring is recommended for inflicting fire-based attacks from far away due to its long range, making it easier to stay out of attack range and inflicting fire damage useful for enemies vulnerable to being put into a special on-fire stun animation.
