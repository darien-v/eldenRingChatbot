As a boss, Sir Gideon Ofnir is the Tarnished leader of the Roundtable that uses advanced Sorceries as well as Incantations, some of which he teaches you in exchange for information. He can be found in Leyndell, Ashen Capital, an instance of the Royal Capital which is accessible only after making significant progress in the story.\nThis is not an optional boss, players must defeat him to advance in Elden Ring. Gideon is a spellcaster and some of the spells he has access to depends on which shardbearers you have defeated or places you've visited and reported to him, or questlines you have completed/not completed before reaching the boss fight. For instance, failing to find and interact with Azur for Sellen's quest gives him access to Comet Azur. Before the fight starts, Gideon makes a rather lengthy speech during which you are free to attack him. He drops the All-Knowing Set and Scepter of the All-Knowing when defeated.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Great Enemy bosses can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items.\n\n Queen Marika has high hopes for us. \n That we continue to struggle, unto eternity.\n\nElden Ring Sir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Boss\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing is a Great Enemy Boss found in Leyndell, Ashen Capital. [Map Link]\n\nThis is not an optional boss.\nSir Gideon Ofnir is a Great Enemy-class boss.\nClosest Site of Grace: Leyndell, Ashen Capital (Stake of Marika is near entrance to boss fight arena).\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss.\nSpirit Ashes are available for this fight.\n\nElden Ring Sir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Location\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing is found in Leyndell, Ashen Capital. This location is available is after completing Crumbling Farum Azula. He is found in the Erdtree Sanctuary building.\n\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG (6226), NG+ (??), NG++ (??), NG+3 (??), NG+4 (??), NG+5 (??), NG+6 (??), NG+7 (??)\nSir Gideon will perform a monologue when facing player for the first time.\nParryable: Yes\nSpell Parry: Yes\nDamage:Standard (conditionally), Strike, Magic,  Fire, Holy.\nInflicts Scarlet Rot (conditionally), Hemorrhage (conditionally)\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being parried, can be backstab critical\nHas increased poise during introduction.\nPoise: 35\n\nAbsorptions:\n\nPhy (Sta): 25\nPhy (Sla): 26\nPhy (Str): 23\nPhy (Thr): 23\nMagic: 25\nFire: 19\nLightning: 1\nHoly: 18\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example if an absorption is 60. 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number= less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances:\n\nPoison: 193\nScarlet Rot: 193\nHemorrhage: 240\nFrostbite: 240\nMadness: 171\nSleep: 163 (stagger only)\nDeath: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers is the buildup amount to trigger it. For example if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Sir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Boss Guide\n\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Sir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing:\n\nUse the Eternal Darkness spell to redirect nearly all his spells\nUse the Inescapable Frenzy spell to deal major damage during his monologue. \n\nAlternatively, Frenzied Burst can prove useful due to long range.\n\nRecommended weapon: Erdtree Greatshield\nUse Spirit Ashes that can quickly close the distance and harass Gideon such as Black Knife Tiche.\nUse heavy jump attacks to disrupt Gideon's more powerful spells as he channels them.\n\nMelee Users\nGideon has access to both Sorceries and Incantations and he can deal a huge amount of damage in a very short time. However, as a magic-focused boss, he is also easily interrupted. His more advanced spells such as Rykard's Rancor and Comet Azur require some channeling and a well-timed heavy jump attack will cause him to plop facedown on the ground, interrupting his cast.\nAnother weakness of Gideon is that nearly all of his attacks are projectiles that can be blocked by terrain and it just so happens there are several pillars conveniently placed on either side of his chamber. Make good use of these pillars, particularly for the same two spells noted above and you should be able to own this fight.\nOne attack of note for melee players to watch out for is his Black Flame Ritual which comes out really quickly and can shred HP in mere seconds. Make sure you are dodging out of range of this as soon as you see the black flames.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nMagic users who are specc'd for the Eternal Darkness spell can near-trivialize this fight. Eternal Darkness creates a void orb that sucks in all projectile-based enemy spells, effectively rendering them useless. This includes his all-powerful Comet Azur beam. Do note that the projectiles can still hit you if you are in their path as they travel towards the void so make sure you are casting Eternal Darkness on one side and moving a few steps away to the side as you pummel Gideon with your own spells.\nEternal Darkness is not a fool-proof plan, however. It has a short duration and you should still be aware of Gideon's most dangerous attacks and use the pillars to your advantage.\nTiche and you combined can stunlock him without bothering with Eternal Darkness. Adula's Moonblade can be effective, or use fast spells to compensate for his tendency to dodge.\nFor Faith, Madness related spells - most notably Frenzied Burst - are useful.\n\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nKnowledge Above All\nGideon raises his scepter and places a debuff on himself and the enemy, characterized by a red eye symbol.\nThis will reduce your magic and holy damage reduction, but also for himself. Make sure to end him quickly.\n\nMelee attack\nInstead of casting debuff, Gideon can postpone it and use his Scepter to swing at player up to 4 times. \nBack away or parry.\n\nComet\nGideon's most used magic attack, firing off a piercing magic projectile that homes in on targets. He will often use this up to four times in succession.\nEasily sidestepped or dodged, just do not underestimate its travel speed. \n\nCarian Phalanx\nGideon summons several magic blades that hover around him, before shooting towards his target.\nUse the pillars to block the blades or sprint to the side in the more open areas of the room.\n\nTriple Rings of Light\nGideon summons three discs of light that travel outward in a fan formation in front of him and then return after a short delay.\nThe further out you are, the bigger the gap between each disc. You can use these gaps to evade them at range. At melee range, try to get behind or to the side of Gideon.\n\nLaw of Causality\nGideon stands still and moves his arms in a gesture, summoning a visage of the Elden Ring on his chest. After taking a certain amount of hits, he will retaliate with a golden blast.\nThe damaging explosion triggers after five hits, and will most likely inflict counter damage when triggered in melee range. Either trigger the explosion at range, or utilize Spirit Ashes and their much higher HP.\n\nRykard's Rancor\nGideon summons a flaming skull that homes in on its target and creates a trail of flame as it flies. After a short delay, explosions are released in a cascading fashion along the trail.\nNeither the skull nor the trail deal damage so use this to your advantage to plan your evasion. Alternatively, you can use the pillars in the chamber to block the skull. Simply stand so a pillar is between you and Gideon as he casts the spell and the skull will get stuck behind the structure, releasing all explosions behind it.\n\nComet Azur\nGideon channels energy into his staff and then releases a powerful beam of magic.\nThis spell is extremely powerful but has a very obvious telegraph. Wait until the last trails of energy are being sucked into his staff before you dodge. Alternatively, you can use the pillars in the room to block the attack. This spell will only be cast if Sellen's questline is NOT completed prior to burning the Erdtree.\n\nBlack Flame Ritual (uncharged)\nGideon quickly releases pillars of black flame all around him.\nDodge out of range immediately.\n\nBloodboon\nGideon will reach into a throws out a spray of bloodflame in a cone formation. This attack applies bleed build up.\n This spell has a wind up time and can be countered by staggering Gideon out of it. The short range of the spell also allows the player to quickly outrange it. This spell will only be cast if Gideon is informed of Mohg, Lord of Blood prior to burning the Erdtree. \n\nScarlet Aeonia\nGideon will jump into the air and turn into a lotus flower before slamming into the ground creating an explosion of scarlet rot. Likewise, this attack applies scarlet rot build up. \n The large wind up time of this attack makes it extremely easy to run away from or roll under as Gideon can not change direction once casting. This spell will only be cast if Gideon is informed of Malenia, Blade of Miquella prior to burning the Erdtree.  \n\n: Attack can be parried     : Attack can be spell parried\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Joe McGann\nHe will gain access to new spells depending on the shardbearers that you have defeated. Informing him of the defeat of Mohg and Malenia will give him access to their spells.\nHe is a caster with Carian Glintblade Staff in the right hand and a Sacred Seal in his left. Very rarely, he may swing with his scepter (which he mostly uses to cast debuff).\n\nDialogue\n§Introduction:\nAhh, I knew you'd come. \nTo stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.\nWhat a sad state of affairs.\nI commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.\nQueen Marika has high hopes for us.\nThat we continue to struggle. Unto eternity.\nDuring Fight:\nDefeating player: My fellow, you've fought well, until now.\nAfter Fight:\nI know...in my bones...\nA Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you.\nA man cannot kill a god...\n\nSir Gideon Ofnir, The All-Knowing Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
