CONTEXT
\n\n Torrent Spirit Steed \n\nTorrent the Spirit Steed is a mount in Elden Ring. He will be your constant companion, used for travel, exploration, and combat.\nTorrent cannot be ridden within dungeons, nor can he be called upon during PvP or Co-op.\n\nUnlock Torrent in Elden Ring\nTo unlock Torrent in Elden Ring, speak to Melina at the Gatefront Ruins Site of Grace. Agree to have her act as your maiden, and she will give you the Spectral Steed Whistle which you can use to summon Torrent. Put the whistle in your quick items or your pouch for easy access, since you'll be using it frequently!\n\nMount\nUse Spectral Steed Whistle\n\nDismount\nUse Spectral Steed Whistle\n\nL3\nLS\nX\n\nTorrent, Spirit Steed in Elden Ring\n\nManeuvering on Torrent\n\nTorrent can run faster and jump further than you can on foot, and learning to ride him effectively will make your time in the Lands Between much easier.\n\nJump\n✖\nA\nF\n\nDouble Jump\nJump → Jump\n\nDash\n⭘\nB\nSpace\n\nTorrent's normal walking speed is about as fast as your running speed on foot, and repeatedly dashing will double your speed again. Although Torrent's dash doesn't provide any invulnerability frames, it's fast enough to outpace almost any enemy, especially if they're winding up an attack.\nTorrent's jumps go further than yours, but his most potent power is the ability to double-jump. This allows you to reach areas that would otherwise be totally inaccessible and even jump over some attacks. You can also change direction as you double-jump, which makes it the quickest way to turn Torrent around while running as well.\nMounted Attacks\nAttacks on horseback differ from those on foot. You can only hold one weapon at once, although you can switch between your right- and left-hand weapon. You can't two-hand a weapon either, so avoid using weapons whose Strength requirements you can only meet while two-handing.\n\nSwap Weapon\n△ + (R1, R2, L1, or L2)\nY + (RB, RT, LB, or LT)\nE + (Left or Right Click)\n\nLeft Light Attack\nL1\nLB\nRight Click\n\nRight Light Attack\nR1\nRB\nLeft Click\n\nLeft Drag Attack\nL2\nLT\nShift + Right Click\n\nRight Drag Attack\nR2\nRT\nShift + Left Click\n\nCast (with Staff or Seal)\nL1\nLB\nRight Click\n\nEach attack has a left- and right-side counterpart, which determines which side of Torrent you swing your weapon on. The light attacks are simple swings of your weapon, while the drag attacks can be held to drag your weapon along the ground, releasing it with a powerful swing. Although the timing is tricky, this is an excellent way to approach an enemy. Larger weapons' drag attacks can even launch foes into the air!\nIf you're wielding a Sacred Seal or a Glintstone Staff, you'll cast a spell instead of doing your right light attack. If you're wielding a Light Bow, Bow, or Crossbow, you'll use the normal control scheme for that weapon instead, with the exception that you still can't use its Skill. Shields, Greatbows, and Ballistas are ineffective on horseback, and act as melee weapons instead.\nHow do you make a Horse Elden Ring Faster?\nThere currently is no stead way to increase the speed of Torrent or other mounts and horses. In Elden Ring players can only sprint on foot. The only other option while mounted is to dash. Although there are some speed running players that claim that mashing your run button while mounted will actually result in a faster run. This will still burn through your stamina quickly if you are engaged in combat. \n\nMounted Combat\n\nYou can do battle while riding Torrent, and in many cases this may be easier than fighting on foot. Torrent's speed makes it easy to outmaneuver most foes or quickly back off to safely heal or attack at range. He also has a hefty health bar of his own, and incoming attacks that are lower to the ground may hit him and leave you unscathed.\nThere are some situations in which mounted combat isn't the best option, though. In enclosed spaces, Torrent's speed can be more of a hindrance than a benefit, especially given how long it takes him to turn around. Torrent also has a Stance bar of his own that repeated attacks can quickly fill, causing you to fall off. If this happens, it'll take a long time for you to get back on your feet, and you'll be vulnerable to attacks until then. Enemies wielding Torchpoles are particularly problematic on horseback, since each attack connects multiple times from a relatively long distance.\nIf Torrent takes damage (or if you just want to give your good boy a treat), he can be healed with Rowa Raisins, Sweet Raisins, Frozen Raisins, and the Flask of Crimson Tears. If Torrent dies, you will fall off and be stunned for multiple seconds. You can still summon Torrent even after he dies, but doing so costs a charge from the Flask of Crimson Tears and requires navigating a confirmation dialog. (If Torrent was merely stance-broken, he can be resummoned at no cost.)\nMounted Tactics\n\nAgainst larger enemies with slower attacks: Ride in, get in a few hits, and dash back out before you take damage. Because mounted attacks have a short delay, it's a good idea to start attacking as you approach the enemy. After the attack lands, continue past the enemy, using a dash or two if necessary to avoid an attack. Once you're clear, turn around, wait for your stamina to recover, and repeat. Getting distance is essential, since you can neither dodge nor guard on horseback.\nAgainst hordes of weaker enemies: Stay outside the group and use your Drag Attack to hit multiple enemies at a time. If you get caught in the middle, you'll quickly be knocked off.\nAgainst ranged enemies: Lock on and spiral in towards them so you can get closer while dodging their projectiles.\nAgainst enemies with faster attacks: Get in close as safely as you can and hit them repeatedly to keep them staggered. If you can't kill them with a single stamina bar, make sure to save some to ride away to safety.\n\nSpiritspring Jumping\n\nDuring your journeys through the Lands Between you'll come across large, twister-like columns that are constantly spinning in place. These are Spiritsprings. You can jump into a Spiritspring while on horseback to ride its current high into the air and land safely nearby. Even if you jump down from a great height, landing near a Spiritspring will ensure you take no fall damage. They're often found near high cliffs and make it easy to pass between areas that differ greatly in altitude.\n\n Spirit Steed Notes & Tips\n\nWhen using a crossbow while galloping on horseback, the player can fire their crossbow while in mid-air without unloading the crossbow as firing it normally would, allowing the player to fire their crossbow a second time immediately upon landing, without needing to reload (the Pulley Crossbow is excluded). This behavior is similar to the rapid follow-up shot the a player can achieve with a shortbow after jumping and firing it, albeit with stricter requirements. \n\n
