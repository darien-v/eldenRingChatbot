CONTEXT
\n\n Equip Load \n\nType\nBase Stat\n\nEffect\nAffects your ability to perform dodge rolls.\n\nAffected by\nEndurance\n\nEquip Load is one of the Stats in Elden Ring. Stats refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. Equip Load determines your mobility based on the total weight of your currently equipped Armaments, Armor, and Talismans, affecting your ability to take evasive actions, depending on the amount of load. It is one of the Base Stats which are directly affected by a player's Main Attribute distribution. Stats such as Equip Load are an important aspect of character progression in Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring Equip Load Guide\n\nEquip Load is a Base Stat that directly affects a character's ability to move and take evasive action. Specifically, Equip Load affects your ability to perform dodge rolls and backsteps.\nEquip Load is represented in the Status Screen as two numbers in a fraction. The number on the left determines the total weight of your currently equipped Weapons, Armor, and Talismans, while the number on the right indicates your Maximum Equip Load, which is directly affected by your Endurance stat.\nHigher total weight equipped increases Fall Damage by a small amount at high Equip Load.\nBackstep recovery time only affects the time it takes to start moving normally after backstepping or to backstep repeatedly, not the time it takes to do a Lunge Attack.\nRolls and backsteps always cost 12 Stamina regardless of Equip Load.\n\nWeight Ratio %\nStatus\nEffect\n\n≤ 29.9%\nLight Load\nRoll has 13 iFrames and 8 recovery frames on 30 FPS. Further roll distance and quicker backstep recovery than normal Equip Load.\n\n30.0% – 69.9%\nMed. Load\nRoll has 13 iFrames and 8 recovery frames on 30 FPS.\n\n70.0% – 99.9%\nHeavy Load\n Roll has 12 iFrames and 16 recovery frames on 30 FPS. Longer roll and backstep recovery than normal Equip Load. Stamina regeneration rate is penalized by about 20%. \n\n≥ 100.0%\nOverloaded\nUnable to perform rolls or backsteps. Standard movement becomes slow and cumbersome.\n\nHow to Increase Maximum Equip Load in Elden Ring\n\nA player's maximum Equip Load can be increased by adding points to Endurance.\nEndurance is one of the 8 Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on to level up.\nThe ability to level up is unlocked shortly after meeting Melina for the first time near the beginning of the game.\nLeveling up can be done at any Sites of Grace once unlocked.\nThe amount of Runes required to raise an Attribute increases with each character Level.\nRunes are obtained primarily by defeating Enemies and Bosses. Certain consumables such as the Fringefolk's Rune can also be used to gain a fixed number of runes.\n\nRELATED EQUIPMENT & ITEMS in Elden Ring for EQUIP LOAD\nYou can use the following Equipment and Items to increase your Equip Load:\n\nArsenal Charm\nGreat-Jar's Arsenal\nErdtree's Favor\n\nELDEN RING EQUIP LOAD NOTES & TIPS\n\nThe maximum obtainable Equip Load is 205.6 and is reached when a character with 99 Endurance equips Great-Jar's Arsenaland Erdtree's Favor +2. This means the highest load you can carry while still maintaining the fastest rolls is 61.4.This can be temporarily increased even further to 925.3 when drinking a Flask of Wondrous Physick with a Winged Crystal Tear.\nElden Ring's Equip Load does not come into play while mounted; using the Spirit Steed will bypass any movement restrictions.\nAdditionally, Stamina is not consumed out of combat, so players can sprint indefinitely while exploring.\nFall Damage is increased starting at 70% Equip Load. At 100% Equip Load, you'll take 10% more damage from falls, up to 30% at 150% Equip Load. \n\nEquip Load Increase by Endurance Level\n\nThe soft caps are 25 and 60.\nThe formulas for calculating Equip Load are as follows: \n\nLevel 1 - 25 --> 45 + 27*((Lvl - 8) / 17)\nLevel 26 - 60 --> 72 + 48*(((Lvl - 25) / 35)^1.1)\nLevel 61 - 99 --> 120 + 40*((Lvl - 60) / 39)\nOnly the first decimal point is kept.\n\nLevel\nEquip Load\nIncrease by\n\n1\n45.0\n\n2\n45.0\n+.0\n\n3\n45.0\n+.0\n\n4\n45.0\n+.0\n\n5\n45.0\n+.0\n\n6\n45.0\n+.0\n\n7\n45.0\n+.0\n\n8\n45.0\n+.0\n\n9\n46.6\n+1.6\n\n10\n48.2\n+1.6\n\n11\n49.8\n+1.6\n\n12\n51.4\n+1.6\n\n13\n52.9\n+1.5\n\n14\n54.5\n+1.6\n\n15\n56.1\n+1.6\n\n16\n57.7\n+1.6\n\n17\n59.3\n+1.6\n\n18\n60.9\n+1.6\n\n19\n62.5\n+1.6\n\n20\n64.1\n+1.6\n\n21\n65.6\n+1.5\n\n22\n67.2\n+1.6\n\n23\n68.8\n+1.6\n\n24\n70.4\n+1.6\n\n25\n72.0\n+1.6\n\n26\n73.0\n+1.0\n\n27\n74.1\n+1.1\n\n28\n75.2\n+1.1\n\n29\n76.4\n+1.2\n\n30\n77.6\n+1.2\n\n31\n78.9\n+1.3\n\n32\n80.2\n+1.3\n\n33\n81.5\n+1.3\n\n34\n82.8\n+1.3\n\n35\n84.1\n+1.3\n\n36\n85.4\n+1.3\n\n37\n86.8\n+1.4\n\n38\n88.1\n+1.3\n\n39\n89.5\n+1.4\n\n40\n90.9\n+1.4\n\n41\n92.3\n+1.4\n\n42\n93.7\n+1.4\n\n43\n95.1\n+1.4\n\n44\n96.5\n+1.4\n\n45\n97.9\n+1.4\n\n46\n99.4\n+1.5\n\n47\n100.8\n+1.4\n\n48\n102.2\n+1.4\n\n49\n103.7\n+1.5\n\n50\n105.2\n+1.5\n\n51\n106.6\n+1.4\n\n52\n108.1\n+1.5\n\n53\n109.6\n+1.5\n\n54\n111.0\n+1.4\n\n55\n112.5\n+1.5\n\n56\n114.0\n+1.5\n\n57\n115.5\n+1.5\n\n58\n117.0\n+1.5\n\n59\n118.5\n+1.5\n\n60\n120.0\n+1.5\n\n61\n121.0\n+1.0\n\n62\n122.1\n+1.1\n\n63\n123.1\n+1.0\n\n64\n124.1\n+1.0\n\n65\n125.1\n+1.0\n\n66\n126.2\n+1.1\n\n67\n127.2\n+1.0\n\n68\n128.2\n+1.0\n\n69\n129.2\n+1.0\n\n70\n130.3\n+1.1\n\n71\n131.3\n+1.0\n\n72\n132.3\n+1.0\n\n73\n133.3\n+1.0\n\n74\n134.4\n+1.1\n\n75\n135.4\n+1.0\n\n76\n136.4\n+1.0\n\n77\n137.4\n+1.0\n\n78\n138.5\n+1.1\n\n79\n139.5\n+1.0\n\n80\n140.5\n+1.0\n\n81\n141.5\n+1.0\n\n82\n142.6\n+1.1\n\n83\n143.6\n+1.0\n\n84\n144.6\n+1.0\n\n85\n145.6\n+1.0\n\n86\n146.7\n+1.1\n\n87\n147.7\n+1.0\n\n88\n148.7\n+1.0\n\n89\n149.7\n+1.0\n\n90\n150.8\n+1.1\n\n91\n151.8\n+1.0\n\n92\n152.8\n+1.0\n\n93\n153.8\n+1.0\n\n94\n154.9\n+1.1\n\n95\n155.9\n+1.0\n\n96\n156.9\n+1.0\n\n97\n157.9\n+1.0\n\n98\n159.0\n+1.1\n\n99\n160.0\n+1.0\n\nAll Stats in Elden Ring\n\nArcane  ♦  Dexterity  ♦  Discovery  ♦  Endurance  ♦  Faith  ♦  Fire Damage Negation  ♦  Fire Defense  ♦  Focus  ♦  Focus Resistance  ♦  FP  ♦  Holy Damage Negation  ♦  Holy Defense  ♦  HP  ♦  Immunity  ♦  Immunity Resistance  ♦  Intelligence  ♦  Level  ♦  Lightning Damage Negation  ♦  Lightning Defense  ♦  Magic Damage Negation  ♦  Magic Defense  ♦  Memory Slots  ♦  Mind  ♦  Physical Defense  ♦  Poise  ♦  Robustness  ♦  Robustness Resistance  ♦  Runes Held  ♦  Stamina  ♦  Strength  ♦  Vigor  ♦  Vitality  ♦  VS Pierce Damage Negation  ♦  VS Pierce Defense  ♦  VS Slash Damage Negation  ♦  VS Slash Defense  ♦  VS Strike Damage Negation  ♦  VS Strike Defense  ♦  Weight\n\n
