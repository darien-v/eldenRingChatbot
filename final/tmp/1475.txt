Margit stands in the Tarnished's way to prevent them from approaching the Elden Ring, though his motivations are only explained in a later encounter.\n\n Someone must extinguish thy flame. \nLet it be Margit the Fell!\n\nMargit, the Fell Omen Boss in Elden Ring\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Castleward Tunnel\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon Spirit Ashes for this boss\nNPC Summons: Sorcerer Rogier can be summoned for this fight. His summon sign is right by the boss entrance\n\nWhere to find Margit, the Fell Omen in Elden Ring\nTake the path north from Stormhill Shack and turn left at the fork, curving back south up a hill full of Godrick Soldiers. You'll need to either fight your way through these soldiers or run past them to reach the Castleward Tunnel Site of Grace, which is just in front of the boss door for Margit, the Fell Omen.

This allows you to get a few free hits. This will not work once he reaches Phase 2. \nUsing the Lone Wolf Ashes can help distract Margit long enough to get some easy damage in with spells or melee attacks. The Spirit Jellyfish can act as a great tanky distraction, and is available if you speak to Roderika in Stormhill.\nAnother good multi-summon Ashes are the Godrick Soldiers, found in the graveyard surrounded by Spirit Jellyfish in Stormhill.\nGlintstone Stars works well in this fight if you can get enough distance to use them. Glintstone Pebble can work fine as well, as it is cheap and reliable.\nWait for him to do his leaping plunge attack with his hammer, and roll through it towards him to get in some easy damage. This is your best opening during this fight.\nAsh of War: Barricade Shield can make this fight much easier for melee players, because it allows them to block and attack more easily, though his spectral blades do not deal Physical Damage, so you still take chip damage.\nGreat boss to learn how to parry. Do note that it takes two parries to put him in a state where he can be riposted. The majority of his staff attacks are parryable, but his magic weapon attacks are not. This simplifies the fight a lot, as most of his attack sequences open with the staff.\n\nMelee Strategy\nThis is an exceptionally difficult fight for melee users, because Margit is extremely aggressive and has somewhat long combos with large wind-ups, making it difficult to block the whole chain of attacks. You'll have to block sparingly, and dodge most of his attacks to maintain enough Stamina to still attack afterwards.\nUsing the Lone Wolf Ashes you can attack him quickly, alongside the wolves, allowing you to break his stance and stagger him for a critical attack. Make sure you keep up the pressure so you can to try to trigger this more often.\nHaving high HP can allow you to trade hits more easily.  Margit does a mix of both Physical and Holy damage (all the yellow glowing weapon effects).  It is advised to wear armor & talismans that helps protect against Physical & Holy damage.  However, t is not recommended to wear armor that results in a Heavy roll.  \nBait his attacks and wait until you are sure he has stopped swinging before attacking, because he can extend certain combos into longer variants if he thinks he can hit you. You'll likely guess wrong a few times, and trade damage, but that's okay.\nLook for his leaping hammer attack and roll through it towards him, and get in a shot or two while he's still in the landing animation. Don't be greedy on this Boss, you can rarely attack more than once without trading damage, and you can't do that every time or you will run out of healing.\nConsider slotting Ash of War: Bloody Slash , as it comes out rather quick, is long ranged, and can be great as a burst damage option. Though keep in mind that it does take away some health as compensation. You should already have this Ash after following through with Kenneth Haight's questline.\n\nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nThe strategy for Magic and Ranged users is somewhat easier, though Shortbow users may have a harder time due to lower damage and lack of a Shield.\nMargit can either be extremely aggressive or not, and there seems to be no in between. If you can keep separation from him until he goes into a "not aggressive" phase, then you can attack him at range fairly easily for a short time, getting some free damage. Just make sure to watch out for his Blade Toss attack, so you don't get hit.\nYou could try using Glintstone Pebble or Glintstone Stars, as these are incredibly effective and efficient. Their cast times are in the mid-range, so be warned that you'll have to have proper spacing to use them. Additionally, it's not a bad idea to use a Shield in your off-hand to block in case of emergencies or after you cast, in case you cut it too close.\nYou can use the Lone Wolf Ashes to create a distraction that can allow you to range him down in less than a minute, if you play it right. Wait for the wolves to gain his attention, then unleash spell after spell, making sure to pause when you gain aggro. This gives the wolves time to acquire it once again before continuing your barrage.\n\nAttacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nStaff Swing\nSwings his staff in many directions with wind-ups ranging from fast to slow\nThis short ranged melee attack is easy to back away from and avoid. You can often fit in an attack during the wind-up for the slower animations\n\nStaff Stab\nStabs his staff directly forward\nRoll to your left. It's tempting to move to his right side, but this will allow him to combo directly into dagger slashes while his left side has no combos after this attack\n\nWindup Attack\nPulls his staff behind his back, then slams it into the ground (if you're close) or rushes forward (if you're further away) and spins clockwise, slashing twice in front of him.\nThe windup is very long, so take advantage of it to get in a few hits. In Phase 1 this will always end his combos if you dodge successfully, so you can get in a hit afterwards as well\n\nDagger Slash\nQuickly slashes a spectral dagger in front of him. Often happens when you're towards his left side.\nDon't get too greedy when punishing a point in his combos that can transition to a Dagger Slash, since it comes out quickly. You can avoid it by staying behind him\n\nDagger Throw\nThrows one or two daggers, usually when you're trying to heal\nRoll when you see a dagger appear in his hands. You can even dodge this just by running to the left or right\n\nDagger Retreat\nSlashes once with a dagger, then jumps backwards and throws it\nDodge twice in quick succession\n\nTail Swipe\nSwings his tail to hit you if you're behind him\nThis has a small radius, so dodge back to avoid it easily\n\nUnguardedSlash\nWhen the player’s guard is broken, he slashes simultaneously with both his staff and spectral sword.\nIt's near impossible to avoid this once it happens since you're already guard-broken, so try to avoid it by limiting how much you block and watching your stamina.\n\nLeaping Stab\nLeaps towards you, hovers in the air for a moment, then slams his staff down\nHe hovers in the air long enough for you to walk out of range and land a few hits as he recovers. \n\nPhase Change\nOnce his health goes below 65%, he summons his spectral hammer to his shoulder, swings it in front of him, leaps high into the air, and slams it down to the ground, creating a shockwave.\nMove away once you see the hammer to avoid the initial swing, then roll once you see him begin to descend to avoid the slam. Get in a few hits while he recovers\n\n   Phase 2\n\nHammer Slam\nRaises his left leg, then smashes his spectral hammer down in front of him\nDodge forward. This attack always ends his combos, so it's safe to land a few hits if you dodge safely\n\nHammer Strike\nSummons a spectral hammer onto his shoulder, then spins around slashing first with his staff and then with his hammer\nDodge away and prepare to dodge more combo moves. Only the cane part of this attack is parriable\n\nHammer Leap\nJumps high into the air and slams his hammer down, creating a shockwave. Almost identical to the phase transition, but this can usually happen without warning.\nDodge forward as you see him beginning to descend. This attack always ends his combos, so get in a few hits if you dodge successfully\n\nWeapon Combo\nAt this point, he can quickly switch out his weapons for a combo, using his staff, sword and hammer subsequently in one combo action.\nDodge back through these until the combo is over, since you won't be able to squeeze in any attacks for the moment. Follow up with your own attack immediately after the combo is complete.\n\nSword Swing\nSlices in front of him with his spectral sword\nRoll away and prepare to dodge more combo moves\n\nSword Spin\nHolds his spectral sword above his head, then spins around slashing first with his sword, then his staff, then sword, then his staff.\nSince this attack covers a long range, it's a good idea to just try to run away. Only the cane swings are parryable\n\n: Attack can be parried\nElden Ring Margit Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Anthony Howell\nUses “Margit, the Fell Omen” boss theme\nThe reason for Margit's appearance in Stormveil is likely due to the fact that Godrick is considered the weakest demigod and would likely be the first target of those seeking the Great Runes.\nMargit will later appear in the Capital Outskirts of Leyndell, posing as a regular Commoner. He will use the exact same moveset, along with the Phase 2 transition. He drops the Viridan Amber Medallion +1 upon defeat.\nDefeating Margit’s true form will also prevent him from appearing at Stormveil Castle. It will also drop the Talisman Pouch. Oddly enough, defeating his true form will not stop the Capital Outskirts encounter from occurring. \nThe ghostly dagger he summons for his dagger throw and slash attacks is an Erdsteel Dagger, and for his hammer slam moves he uses a Giant-Crusher. The straight sword he summons for some of his spinning combos is a Carian Knight's Sword.\nMargit being the first boss makes the 2nd most attempted boss in the game with 281 million attempts by players.\n\nFAQ: How do you stun the First Boss Elden ring?\n\nTo help with your first encounter against Margit the Fell Omen, players may come back with Margit's Shackle. This item, when used during one of Margit's boss fights, causes Margit to violently slam against the floor, inflicting no damage, but stunning him for a brief moment.  This effect will also interrupt anything Margit was doing at the time. The effect of this item can only be activated twice during the boss fight and only during Margit's first phase. Attempting to use the shackle otherwise will have the player go through the animation, but will have no effect whatsoever.\nThis item can be purchased from Patches for  5000 Runes in Murkwater Cave. [Map Link] After he becomes available as a merchant. Or it can be purchased from the Twin Maiden Husks at the Roundtable Hold, after giving them Patches's Bell Bearing. Video Location\nIf players still have difficulty facing this boss, players can consider using Spirit Ashes, or wielding Weapons with the Bleed effect on it to cause great damage. Magic players can select mid ranged heavy attacks and take an aggressive approach to wear out his HP bar. Definitely take advantage of his stunned period because this is when you can land the most amount of hits without risk of damage. Immediately create some distance once the stun effect has worn off. \n\nDialogue\nIntroduction:\nFoul tarnished, \nin search of the Elden Ring.\nEmboldened by the flame of ambition.\nSomeone must extinguish thy flame.\nLet it be Margit the Fell!\nDuring Fight:\nDefeating player: Put these foolish ambitions to rest.\nAt 60% health: Well, thou art of passing skill.
