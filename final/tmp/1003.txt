He reigned as the current Elden Lord at some time before the reign of Marika and the Golden Order and presumably ruled alongside his god, who later fled. The Old Lord's Talisman suggests that Placidusax had at least two more heads that had been removed by the time the Tarnished reaches him.\nThis is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring.\n\n The Dragonlord whose seat lies at the heart of the storm beyond time is said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the Erdtree. Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return.\n\nElden Ring Dragonlord Placidusax Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Beside the Great Bridge\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss (put your summon sign near the entrance of the boss arena)\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Dragonlord Placidusax Location\nFrom the Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace, turn around and take the elevator back down into the church. Go past the Beastmen and exit the church. Head straight ahead out of the church, towards the cluster of trees, and look over the edge for a platform to fall down to. Follow the path down to the end, and look for a cubby on the stone floor that doesn't have bones in it. Approach and look for the Lie down prompt. This will teleport you to Placidusax's arena.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 means the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 1349 / 1806\nScarlet Rot: 1349 / 1806\nHemorrhage: 1349 / 1806\nFrostbite: 1349 / 1806\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

He will always cast this move at the start of the fight.\n\nMelee Users\nDragonlord Placidusax’s attacks are quick and hit hard, but have a generous amount of time between them where you can get easy hits in. Like other dragons, his weak spot is his heads, but unlike other dragons, the opportunities you will get as melee to hit him in the head are rare and unreliable. The safest spot to attack Placidusax is around the base of his tail near his hind legs, behind his wings. This puts you in a position where you will avoid his wing slam, won’t trigger his tail swipe, and unlike other dragons, he has no attacks with his back feet that you’ll have to worry about.\nWhen the fight begins, you will want to quickly close the distance to Placidusax. He will summon large lightning bolts around the arena but these are out of the way and won’t require dodging. Differing from lightning strikes used by previous bosses, instead of small direct bolts, the lightning that Placidusax summons are large AOE bolts, and you can take note of their general size while running towards him. He will summon a second wave of these bolts around the time you get within striking range. You should be moving immediately when the red indicators show up, not just to get out of the way but to give yourself more time to attack. Between each strike you can get 1-4 hits in safely before needing to move again, depending on the speed of your weapon. For colossal weapon users, you only have time to get one heavy/jump attack in before needing to move for the next lightning bolt. After three lightning strikes hit, the move will end.\nFollowing this, Placidusax has a few different moves for the first half of the fight that are all relatively simple and trigger based on your location to him.\nPlacidusax has two different swiping attacks that he will use often where his hands grow long, red lightning claws. When he raises his left hand (your right if facing him), he will do a wide horizontal slash that is easily avoided by rolling into the direction the claw is coming from. When he raises his right hand (your left if facing him), he will bring the claw vertically down into the ground and cause a small lightning explosion on impact. This, too, can be easily avoided with one dodge by rolling towards him. The explosion is small enough and quick enough that you do not need to worry about being hit by it from rolling too soon.\nPlacidusax also has a couple of fire-breathing moves you’ll need to look out for. He will jump away a short distance and then both heads will spray flames into the ground in front and in a semicircle around him. Luckily, the distance the flames travel is generously short and in most cases, the distance he jumps away from you will be further than his flames will end up reaching. Just wait for the flames to dissipate and run back in. He will also breathe flames down his left or right side at you, depending on which flank you are attacking. If positioned near his back legs, the area around his tail's base will actually be curved up high enough for you to roll under it to the other side, making this attack trivial to avoid and giving you a huge amount of time to punish the boss.\nTwo other physical attacks of note that can be triggered based on positioning: if you are on his side near his wings, he will slam his wing down into the ground and then ram it outwards, causing massive physical damage; and if you are too far away from his body near his tail, he will spin and whip horizontally with his tail.\nOnce you get Placidusax near 50%, he will rise into the air and disappear, signaling the phase change. Storm clouds will form somewhere in the air and you must rotate your camera to look around for them, as Placidusax will rematerialize out of them in a fast dive attack towards you with one set of claws out. It looks more menacing than it actually is, and a single roll toward him will carry you through it unscathed. He then follows this up with a few attacks where he will disappear and reappear quickly in sequence, doing a claw attack each time. You can target lock when he appears for the first attack and the lock will remain on him even when he disappears for all the following attacks, taking away any difficulty of having to guess where he’s going to appear. The claw attacks in phase two now have a second portion to them, where he will follow up the swipe or slam by dragging his claws back in the opposite direction. The timing does not change, however; you just now have to roll twice instead of once. If you are feeling bold, you can roll towards his armpit while avoiding the first claw swipe, and the second part of the swipe will naturally miss you, allowing you to get in a quick hit or two before he disappears. As part of this disappearing/reappearing phase, he might also pull out a new attack where he does a short flight/lunge across with claws out; essentially a baby version of the dive he did to open the phase. Like his other attacks, a single roll under and toward him is all you need.\nAt any point for the rest of the fight, he can start doing the entire above sequence again, so just be on your guard and ready to start dodging when he dissolves. The trickiest part is that he can summon the lightning bolts from the first half while doing the divebomb and phasing in and out. You will have to be rotating the camera to look for where he’s going to dive from, while also sprinting to keep out of the large lightning blasts that are targeting the area. The attacks themselves aren’t too difficult to avoid, but the large amount of visual clutter going off can make it tough to see what’s happening.\nPlacidusax’s flames also receive an upgrade in the second half, and both heads can suddenly turn their fire into laser beams that cut back and forth across the arena, causing massive damage if they hit you. These move fast and look unpredictable but there is a pattern where one head starts far and makes three swathes back and forth, getting closer to him with each pass. The other head moves in the opposite pattern, starting close to him and making passes left and right while getting farther from him with each pass. If you are not near him when this starts, your best bet is to try to move far enough to one side so that you only have to worry about dodging one laser. If you are close to him, you can quickly run under the lasers and have several seconds of free time to attack him. Just be cautious of the lasers at the end of this attack as he brings them both back in towards his body. Even if you aren’t close enough to exploit the opening at the start of the attack, at the end of the attack he spends a couple of seconds shooting the lasers into the sky and roaring, allowing you to still get in a couple of free hits.\nThe last new attack you might encounter in the second half is Placidusax will summon a large lightning spear (Identical to Bolt of Gransax, albeit made of Ancient Dragon Lightning) and stab it into the ground, causing a large red circle AOE to appear before setting off a massive explosion. This move seems to be all show though, as you have several seconds to run away out of it before it actually goes off, even if you don’t notice the spear until it’s already in the ground. The attack will also cause your audio to go mute, giving you a very apparent audial cue that you need to be moving away.\nBesides the new additions, Placidusax can also still use any of his attacks from the first phase so be mindful of positioning and you’ll breeze right through the fight. His moves leave plenty of openings for free hits without needing to make your own windows so as long as you don’t get greedy, you should make it through the fight without much issue.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nShard Spiral can deal tremendous damage to the boss (enough to even skip the 2nd phase if lucky). Use Godfrey Icon along with your other magic buffs. During the first phase use the spell after charging it fully and use it close to the boss so more of the spell travels through him. During the transition to the 2nd phase after reaching the middle of the boss's health bar spam the uncharged shard spiral while you are still locked on to him and he should be either dead or nearly dead. Night Maiden’s Mist can be highly effective, as it often stands still when attacking, while Tiche or some other summon draws most of his attention. Just be wary of the phase two disappearance moves, as sometimes it can be hard to tell when he's done and can catch you if you commit to a spell too early. \nAs for incantations, Swarm of Flies deals great damage to the boss, applying Hemorrhage pretty quickly. The first phase won't be hard as the boss mostly stays still, but in the second phase, the dragon is getting much more mobile, so casting more than 2 spells after his attacks is very dangerous. It is also highly recommended to use Bloodhound's Step to easily dodge and keep distance to use spells safely. Other notable incantations are Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike and Pest Threads for both of which the user needs to be close to the dragonlord in order for them to deal tremendous damage. Pest Threads is more FP efficient than Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike but requires better positioning than the other in order to deal the most damage. Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike is able to shred the Dragonlord's HP a lot faster so it is recommended if you have high FP.\n\nDragonlord Placidusax Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nAncient Dragons' Lightning Strike\nPlacidusax will roar, summoning lightning strikes across the arena. Red sparks will appear before the lightning lands. Three of them will target the player sequentially, while others are randomized. \nEquip Lightning damage negation. Move out of the strike zones or roll through the strikes, and attack Placidusax between lightning strikes.\n\nOverbalancing Swipe\nPlacidusax raises his right arm and summons claws of red lightning. He then lunges forwards to slash at the player, falling partially onto his side as he does.\nRoll to your left through the attack.\n\nClaw Swipe\nPlacidusax raises his left or right arm and summons claws of red lightning. He then sweeps them from his left to his right (if attacking with his left hand) or from his right to his left (if attacking with his right hand).\nRoll through the attack, preferably in the direction Placidusax is swinging his arm from.\n\nClaw Smash\nPlacidusax raises either his right or left arm up high and summons claws of red lightning. He then slams them down in front of his chest, creating a large burst of electrical energy.\nMove towards Placidusax’s flanks, or dodge late through the blast.\n\nClaw Scrape\nAfter a Claw Smash or Swipe, Placiudsax keeps his electrical claws active and pulls them back along his body.\nRoll backward to exploit the attack’s short range.\n\nDouble Claw Slam\nPlacidusax raises both of his hands and summons claws of red lightning. He then slams them down in front of himself, causing a large electrical explosion. This attack is only used as a follow-up to his Overbalancing Swipe.\nSprint behind Placidusax, or roll late through the attack.\n\nRearing Claw-Firebreath Combo\nPlacidusax raises his left arm and summons claws of red lightning. He delays for an extended period and then swipes from his left to his right, rising onto his hind legs as he does. He then spews golden fire in wide arcs in front of himself.\nSprint behind Placidusax and attack his tail and hips. Do not stand in his crotch; the fire goes far enough back to reach you there.\n\nCrawling Claw-Firebreath Combo\nPlacidusax raises his left arm and summons claws of red lightning. After delaying for a moderate period, he swipes from his left to his right, then begins breathing golden fire in wide arcs in front of himself.\nSprint to Placidusax’s side or hips and attack him.\n\nRearwards Firebreath\nThis attack is commonly used when the player is at Placidusax’s hindlegs or sides. Placidusax looks back over his shoulder, then begins breathing gouts of golden fire along that side of his body and in front of himself.\nWhen at Placidusax’s side, keep an eye on the front of his body. If the dragonlord looks at you and fire particles begin to appear in his mouth, immediately sprint backward and away from his body.\n\nRepositioning Firebreath\nPlacidusax leaps backward and to his left or right, spewing a bout of golden fire at the ground between himself and the player as he lands.\nWait a moment for the fire to dissipate, then pursue Placidusax.\n\nLeaping Claws\nPlacidusax rises slightly and begins to glow with tendrils of red lightning. He then leaps forwards at the player, summoning claws of red lightning on his right hand and swiping as he hits the ground at their location. As he lands, Placidusax spins himself around to face the direction he jumped from.\nRoll to your left, then pursue the dragonlord.\n\nBoulder Throw Combo\nThis attack is occasionally used when Placidusax wants to adjust his positioning and face the player more closely. The dragonlord raises his left arm and summons claws of red lightning. He then scrapes them across the ground in front of him and along his left side, turning slightly to face the player as he does. Then, Placidusax digs his right hand into the ground and flings a spread of rocks at the player.\nMove backward out of the range of the claw swipe, then roll forwards through the rocks to attack Placidusax.\n\nWing Slam-Swing Combo\nThis attack is only used when the player is on Placidusax’s left side. The dragon raises his left wing, then slams the edge of it into the ground at his side. After a moment of hesitation, he whips his wing outwards and up.\nRoll once to dodge the initial slam, then roll through the follow-up wing swing and attack Placidusax.\n\nBite\nA rarely used attack is employed when the player stands to the side of Placidusax near his front end. Placidusax will look to the side that the player is on and then bite once with each head, one after the other.\nMove away from Placidusax to get slightly out of range, and then jump attack one of his heads as he finishes the second bite.\n\nTailslam Turnaround\nPlacidusax commonly uses this attack to turn around when the player is standing behind him. The dragon curls to his left or right side, raising his tail and slamming it down onto the ground as he turns around.\nMove towards the tip of Placidusax’s tail or back up. Alternatively, roll through the attack.\n\nTailsweep Turnaround\nPlacidusax commonly uses this attack to turn around when the player is standing behind him. The dragon curls to his left or right side, sweeping his tail across the ground as he turns around\nMove towards the tip of Placidusax’s tail or back up. Alternatively, roll through the attack.\n\nBolt of Placidusax\nPlacidusax raises his left hand and summons a massive bolt of red lightning. He then slams it into the ground in front of himself, dealing heavy damage to anything caught under the attack and embedding the bolt in the floor of the arena. At this point, waves of red lightning begin to emanate outwards from the bolt along the ground while Placidusax raises his hand above it. The Dragonlord then slams his right hand down on the bolt, detonating it in an enormous explosion of red lightning.\nSprint away from Placidusax. The rings of red lightning that emanate from the bolt roughly indicate how far the explosion will reach; stand just outside where they stop, then run in to attack the Dragonlord as the explosion dissipates.\n\nStationary Thundercloud Form (phases 2 and 3 only)\nThis attack is always used to initiate phase 2. Placidusax turns to mist and vanishes. A few moments later, a stationary stormcloud with red lightning appears in the sky. The dragonlord appears within it, then swoops down to strike at the player with claws of red lightning on his left hand. As he lands, he will spin to face the direction he flew down from.\nWhen Placidusax disappears, turn the camera around the arena to identify which direction he will be swooping from. Then, as he swoops down at you, roll to your right through the attack, turn around, and pursue Placidusax.\n\nTraveling Thundercloud Form (phases 2 and 3 only)\nPlacidusax leaps forwards into the air, turning to mist as he rises higher. Moments later, a stormcloud with red lightning will appear and begin to move to the player’s left in the sky. The dragonlord then emerges from the cloud, diving downwards and striking with claws of red lightning on his right hand. He slams into the ground and drags them as he slides, creating a massive burst of red lightning in his wake, but unlike the Stationary Thundercloud Form, Placidusax will not turn around to face the player as he completes this attack.\nAfter Placidusax disappears, turn the camera around the arena to identify which direction he will swoop from. As he appears, move left, and then roll late as he dives down to strike you. Then, turn around and pursue the dragonlord.\n\nTeleportation (Phases 2 and 3 only)\nPlacidusax turns to mist and vanishes, reappearing shortly afterward in another location. He will often reappear with an attack already beginning, and if he was performing a combo when he vanished, he will often continue that combo when he reappears.\nLock onto Placidusax; the lock should follow him to some extent and make his reappearance easier to locate. If he was performing a combo, be ready for potential follow-ups. Otherwise, prepare to dodge whatever attack he emerges with.\n\nPlacidusax’s Ruin(phase 3 only)\nPlacidusax will use Ancient Dragon's Lightning Strike, but will instead turn to mist and disappear early in the animation. A single bolt of red lightning will be summoned at the player’s location. Moments later Placidusax will execute his Stationary Thundercloud Form, appearing in the sky and swooping down to strike them. As he turns around following this move, Placidusax will breathe gouts of golden fire across the ground in front of himself. These gouts of fire then turn to devastating golden lasers, and Placidusax sweeps them sequentially across the arena before firing them into the sky.\n Ideally, after dodging the lightning bolt and divebomb, you will be able to either sprint up to Placidusax and hug his side where the lasers and fire do not reach or sprint far enough backwards to be out of range of the lasers. If this is not possible, you will have to dodge some or all of the lasers. They move according to the following pattern (all directions are in reference to the player’s point of view; that is, “right head” is the head on the right when looking at Placidusax from in front of him, left and right are the player’s left and right, etc.): 1: Placidusax begins with the right head aiming diagonally to the right and the left head aiming diagonally to the left. 2: Right head beam sweeps to the left (dodge to the right). 3: Right head beam sweeps back to the right (dodge to the left) 4: Right head beam sweeps to the left and left head beam sweeps to the right (dodge to the right, because the right head beam extends farther) 5: Both beams are brought back towards Placidusax’s chest, then fired along the ground in a straight line in front of the Dragonlord (move sideways) Frequently, you will be in a position where the only beam long enough to reach you is that of the right head in step 4. If you are not confident in your ability to dodge this attack, consider mixing an Opaline Bubbletear into your Flask of Wondrous Physick to massively reduce the damage should you fail. \n\nDragonlord Placidusax Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nAs pointed out by the youtuber Antonius Tertius, the Latin student who contacted the music producers and singers of the game, the name Placidusax is a compound of 2 Latin words: PLACIDUS(quiet,still) and SAXUM(large stone, rock); however he stresses that the lyrics are not in Latin and convey no lore at all. He published what the choir sings on Youtube and explained how the lyrics were made.\nThe position that Placidusax is in, with his two heads looking towards the sky, is similar to how the Two Fingers commune with the Greater Will. He may be attempting to reach and/or contact his god, who apparently fled the Lands Between.\nAccording to the Old Lord’s Talisman, he is depicted as having four heads. \n\nThis is contradictory to the analysis of Placidusax's model/artwork, which reveals that he had five heads, as he has three stumps where the heads should have been.\n\nPlacidusax is said to be the previous Elden Lord before the arrival of the Erdtree.\nThe Ancient Dragon and Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones are said to be the scales of the Dragonlord. Due to their unique ability to twist time, Weapons upgraded with these Smithing Stones are capable of harming and slaying gods.\nPlacidusax has an extra model with one of his remaining heads cut off. This was suggested that you could cut off one of them during the fight, but this was likely cut due to the heads being out of reach of melee attacks.\nThe Red Lightning Bolt he summons is reminiscent of the Bolt of Gransax, used by the massive ancient dragon inside the Royal Capital. Ironically, this dragon is much larger than Placidusax himself, taking up a large portion of the dungeon.\nThough he has no actual idle animation while hovering before the fight, Placidusax will flinch when struck by arrows while doing so. Each wing, including the vestigial stumps of his second pair, each arm, each leg, the tail, each head, and his entire body (shot to the torso) can flinch.\nThe Dragon King's Cragblade, the weapon you can get from his Remembrance, is a possible reference to the tail-cut weapons from Dark Souls I, where cutting off the tails of certain dragons will net you a special weapon. Placidusax's own tail appears to have been cut off as well. \n\nDragonlord Placidusax Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
