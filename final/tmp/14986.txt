This a massive quadruped is covered in crystals and is found in multiple locations. This is an optional boss as players are not required to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring, but doing so will yield useful items and Runes.\nSee also Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast.\n\nElden Ring Fallingstar Beast Location\n\nSellia Crystal Tunnel [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nAltus Plateau [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nFallingstar Beast Combat information\n\nStance: 100\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\n Gravity type\nWeak spot: Face and rump (+50% damage)\nDamage: Standard, Strike, Pierce, Magic\nInflicts Hemorrhage\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 35\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 35\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Fallingstar Beast Boss Guide\n\nFallingstar Beast Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Fallingstar Beast:\n\nAny Throwing Pot can be used to hit its face while it charges to knock it to the ground\nUse ashes that deal elemental damage, like Glintstone Sorcerer or Twinsage Sorcerer\nUse the Hoarfrost Stomp skill as an easy source of elemental damage\nAlmost all of its attacks do Physical damage, so bring a Shield with 100% Physical Resistance\n\nMelee Users\nPlay it Safe: Fallingstar Beasts have high defense, lots of health, strong attacks, and quick movement. Focus on staying alive and learning to dodge its various attacks. Try to stay two or three boss-lengths away and wait for good openings where you can get in one or two attacks, particularly on its vulnerable face. Even when it raises its head, you can often hit its face with a jump attack.\nCritical Theory: When you break Fallingstar Beast's stance and get the opportunity for a critical hit, don't take it right away. It'll stay down for four full seconds, during which its face is totally vulnerable. Get in a couple good whacks before you do the critical hit by using heavy attacks or jump attacks to avoid triggering the crit too early.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nDodge and Weave: The most important thing to do is avoid death. This is a long battle against a strong foe, so focus on learning to dodge or block its attacks and only get in your own damage during one of the Fallingstar Beast's long recovery periods. Be patient, don't get greedy, and eventually you'll take it down.\n\nFallingstar Beast Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nHead Swing\nSwings its head in various directions to hit the player with its mandibles\nMaintain distance or dodge toward its sides and get a few hits in while it finishes attacking\n\nTail Sweep\nPivots, may pause for a bit, then sweeps its tail along the ground to hit the player\nWait until you see the tail actually make contact with the ground, then roll through it\n\nHind Stomp\nRears onto its front legs, then slams down its hind legs. Usually used when you're behind it\nDodge backwards when you see its legs fold up towards its torso\n\nFore Stomp\nRears onto its hind legs, then slams down its front feet (and sometimes its head as well)\nRoll backwards and don't try to punish this, just wait out its combo\n\nGouge\nSpreads its mandibles and shoves them into the ground, then rips them up while moving forward\nRoll diagonally forward and to the side\n\nBite\nHops back and turns its left flank to you, clicks its mandibles together, then swoops down counterclockwise to bite you. If it hits, lifts you up then slams you down\nDodge right as soon as you see it start to swoop down, then unlock and get in a few hits on its vulnerable face\n\nRock Throw\nJams its head into the ground, then jerks it out throwing forward a spray of rocks\nEither guard or roll forward through the rocks. The rocks fly far, so be ready to roll no matter where you are in the arena\n\nRock Sweep\nRears its hind legs into the air as it pivots, then sweeps its tail along the ground in the same direction as its pivot kicking rocks into the air\nMove towards the Beast and the rocks will often go over your head on their own, but roll into them just in case\n\nBeast Roll\nBacks up, then jumps into the air and curls into a ball. After hovering for a moment, crashes down towards the player\nRoll to either side as soon as you see it start to descend, then get in a few hits while it recovers\n\nGravitas\nRises onto its hind legs, then falls down with a burst of purple magic which pulls you in if you're nearby, then raises its head and summons rocky spikes out of the ground around it\nYou can sprint away when you see it rear up, but this attack doesn't do much damage so it may be worth just trading hits\n\nGravity Bolt\nIts mandible glow purple lightning as lightning gathers under your feet, then lifts its head and calls a small cluster of stone spikes up where the lightning lingers. Does this once more in a small area, then finally in a much larger area\nSprint to avoid the first two hits, then sprint to the edge of the area of the third hit and roll as you approach the boundary. Try to end up near the boss to get in a few hits as it recovers\n\nCharge\nLowers its head, opens its mandibles, and paws at the ground with its front hoof before charging full-speed towards the player, doubling back twice\nRoll to either side as it approaches, or else hit its face with any attack that deals any amount of stance damage (including spells and throwing pots) to cause it to fall to the ground and give you time to get in several hits\n\nFallingstar Beast Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nOther Notes and Trivia Go Here\n\nFallingstar Beast Combo Chart\n\n Fallingstar Beast  Sellia Crystal Tunnel  \n\nDrops\n\n7,600Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (1)Smithing Stone (7) x5Somber Smithing Stone (6)Gravity Stone Chunk x4\n\nHP\n4,554\n\nElden Ring Fallingstar Beast Boss (Sellia Crystal Tunnel)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Sellia Crystal Tunnel\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nFallingstar Beast Location\nThe end boss of Sellia Crystal Tunnel. [Map Link]\nFallingstar Beast Combat information\n\nHealth: 4,554 HP \nDefense: 109\nDrops 7,600, Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (1), Smithing Stone (7) x5, Somber Smithing Stone (6), Gravity Stone Chunk x4 (NG+: x10)\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 534 / 824 / 1281\nScarlet Rot: 534 / 824 / 1281\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.
