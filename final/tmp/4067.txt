The Envoy's Greathorn scales primarily with Strength and is a good Weapon for dealing Holy damage. \n\nFanned golden horn of the Oracle Envoys. Profoundly weighty, its blows are sure to be felt.\nOriginally an instrument, but one that cannot be sounded by a mere human. Or perhaps it is too early to sound the call.\n\nWhere to Find Envoy's Greathorn in Elden Ring\nThe Envoy's Greathorn weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nDropped by Giant Oracle Envoy. They are found in Miquella's Haligtree. \nBeginning at Haligtree Canopy Site of Grace, head up the branch in front of you and take a left towards the three Oracle Envoys. Immediately after passing the second Oracle Envoy, turn right and jump off the mushroom that leads to another branch containing a large Oracle Envoy. Run past this enemy until you reach a cluster of mushrooms. Jump from here, down to the large branch containing the patrolling giant ants. Sneak past or fight your way through them (if you reset the area and immediately head along through this route, once you jump down onto the large branch, you should only have to deal with one Giant Ant) and head up the branch. This will take you directly to a lone Giant Oracle Envoy.\nAlternative route can be taken from Haligtree Town Site of Grace: go back and up the ladder, run up the wide branch, jump down from the third cluster of mushrooms onto the narrow branch to the left and then go left again to the first Envoy. Three timed rolls are needed for this part. Flask of Wondrous Physick with Opaline Hardtear and Opaline Bubbletear combined with Lord's Divine Fortification are a tremendous help. Up the branch with first Giant Oracle Envoy is the second one grouped with a Large Oracle Envoy and two Oracle Envoy's. \n\nAlternative option: From the Haligtree Town Site of Grace, go back and up the ladder, run onto the wide branch and stop before the first two Scarlet Rot Miranda Sprouts (killing them helps). There should be a part of the branch that sticks up slightly right where the first sprout was, with a disc shape facing away from the Giant Oracle Envoy above. Walking into it or casting spells should not move your character from here, so casting spells with an arc and an explosion such as Cannon of Haima while aiming straight up will kill the first Envoy and prevent the stress of making it onto the same branch. Then it is trivial to kill the second Giant Oracle Envoy and its accompanying Large Oracle Envoy.\n\nElden Ring Envoy's Greathorn Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Great Oracular Bubble\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nEnvoy's Greathorn can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nSell Value:   100\nBase drop rate is 2% (at 100 Discovery)\nAdditionally, the Ash of War: Assassin's Gambit or the Concealing Veil (while crouched) can make the run easier. \nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, Colossal Weapons poise damage has been reduced. \nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
