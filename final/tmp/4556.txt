CONTEXT
\n\n Ash of War: Holy Ground \n\nAffinity\nSacred\n\nSkill\nHoly Ground\n\nEffect\nGrants affinities and skills to an armament\n\nAsh of War: Holy Ground is an Ash of War and Upgrade Material in Elden Ring. Ash of War: Holy Ground provides Sacred affinity and the Holy Ground Skill. Ashes of War can be equipped on Weapons and Shields to modify the Skill or an equipment, or to apply affinities that modify scaling values.\n\nThis Ash of War grants an armament the Sacred affinity and the following skill:\n"Holy Ground: Raise shield to create an Erdtree-consecrated area that continuously restores HP and boosts defense for self and allies inside it."\nUsable on all shields.\n\nAsh of War: Holy Ground Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to find Ash of War: Holy Ground:\n\nObtained inside the Auriza Hero's Grave by destroying three specific Chariots. [Elden Ring Map Link]\nDoing this involves quite a few steps:\n\nFrom this first Chariot Hall, drop down the openings on either side just before the second ramp.\nIn the room below, head west and up the steps and then turn right in the next corridor. Follow the path and you will end up in a large Chariot Hall where two Chariots are running almost side by side, with a short delay between them. These are the Chariots you need to destroy.\nHead down the hall all the way to the bottom where there is a large pit behind some pillars. Looking down, you will find several wooden beams you can drop down onto.\nNavigate your way down onto the lowest beam you can drop down to and then head south towards an archway with a ladder in the back. Climb up the ladder to reach another Chariot Hall with a single Chariot.\nWait for the Chariot to head downwards and then run up the ramp and enter the chamber on the right where you will find a flamethrower pillar. Hit the pillar to raise it which will activate the circular golden seal in the middle of the large double Chariot Hall, teleporting the Chariot from the third hall and causing it to collide with the double Chariots.\nFrom here, you will need to return to the large hall to witness the collision event and collect your items. The easiest way to do this is by killing yourself or using the Memory of Grace tool (if you don't care about your runes) to return to the Site of Grace. Alternatively, from the flamethrower pillar room, return to the third Chariot Hall, go all the way down the ramp and turn left into a corridor. Take another left to find a lift which will take you up to a chamber where the flamethrower pillar was raised. Wait for breaks between flame spews and head through the corridor in the north. There is an alcove on the right halfway through the corridor which you can use to safely wait for another break before heading towards the end. At the end of this corridor, you can turn left to return to the large Chariot Hall. After the Chariots crash into each other, you will receive the Ash of War along with the Tree Sentinel Armor Set.\n\nAsh of War: Holy Ground Elden Ring Guide\n\nGrants the skill Holy Ground.\nCan be used with the following affinity Upgrades: Standard, Heavy, Keen, Quality, Lightning, Sacred\nCan be applied to the following shield categories, so long as the shield allows skill replacement: Small Shields, Medium Shields, Greatshields\nLasts for 35 Sec and consumes 30FP, heals around 17 HP/Sec (restores 600 HP over the duration)\nStacks with Blessed Dew Talisman\n\nHoly Ground Demonstration\n\nElden Ring Ash of War: Holy Ground Notes & Tips\n\nNotes and player tips go here.\n\nElden Ring Ashes of War\n\nAsh of War: Assassin's Gambit  ♦  Ash of War: Barbaric Roar  ♦  Ash of War: Barrage  ♦  Ash of War: Barricade Shield  ♦  Ash of War: Beast's Roar  ♦  Ash of War: Black Flame Tornado  ♦  Ash of War: Blood Blade  ♦  Ash of War: Blood Tax  ♦  Ash of War: Bloodhound's Step  ♦  Ash of War: Bloody Slash  ♦  Ash of War: Braggart's Roar  ♦  Ash of War: Carian Grandeur  ♦  Ash of War: Carian Greatsword  ♦  Ash of War: Carian Retaliation  ♦  Ash of War: Charge Forth  ♦  Ash of War: Chilling Mist  ♦  Ash of War: Cragblade  ♦  Ash of War: Determination  ♦  Ash of War: Double Slash  ♦  Ash of War: Earthshaker  ♦  Ash of War: Enchanted Shot  ♦  Ash of War: Endure  ♦  Ash of War: Eruption  ♦  Ash of War: Flame of the Redmanes  ♦  Ash of War: Flaming Strike  ♦  Ash of War: Giant Hunt  ♦  Ash of War: Glintblade Phalanx  ♦  Ash of War: Glintstone Pebble  ♦  Ash of War: Golden Land  ♦  Ash of War: Golden Parry  ♦  Ash of War: Golden Slam  ♦  Ash of War: Golden Vow  ♦  Ash of War: Gravitas  ♦  Ash of War: Ground Slam  ♦  Ash of War: Hoarah Loux's Earthshaker  ♦  Ash of War: Hoarfrost Stomp  ♦  Ash of War: Ice Spear  ♦  Ash of War: Impaling Thrust  ♦  Ash of War: Kick  ♦  Ash of War: Lifesteal Fist  ♦  Ash of War: Lightning Ram  ♦  Ash of War: Lightning Slash  ♦  Ash of War: Lion's Claw  ♦  Ash of War: Loretta's Slash  ♦  Ash of War: Mighty Shot  ♦  Ash of War: No Skill  ♦  Ash of War: Parry  ♦  Ash of War: Phantom Slash  ♦  Ash of War: Piercing Fang  ♦  Ash of War: Poison Moth Flight  ♦  Ash of War: Poisonous Mist  ♦  Ash of War: Prayerful Strike  ♦  Ash of War: Prelate's Charge  ♦  Ash of War: Quickstep  ♦  Ash of War: Rain of Arrows  ♦  Ash of War: Raptor of the Mists  ♦  Ash of War: Repeating Thrust  ♦  Ash of War: Royal Knight's Resolve  ♦  Ash of War: Sacred Blade  ♦  Ash of War: Sacred Order  ♦  Ash of War: Sacred Ring of Light  ♦  Ash of War: Seppuku  ♦  Ash of War: Shared Order  ♦  Ash of War: Shield Bash  ♦  Ash of War: Shield Crash  ♦  Ash of War: Sky Shot  ♦  Ash of War: Spectral Lance  ♦  Ash of War: Spinning Slash  ♦  Ash of War: Spinning Strikes  ♦  Ash of War: Spinning Weapon  ♦  Ash of War: Square Off  ♦  Ash of War: Stamp (Sweep)  ♦  Ash of War: Stamp (Upward Cut)  ♦  Ash of War: Storm Assault  ♦  Ash of War: Storm Blade  ♦  Ash of War: Storm Stomp  ♦  Ash of War: Storm Wall  ♦  Ash of War: Stormcaller  ♦  Ash of War: Sword Dance  ♦  Ash of War: Thops's Barrier  ♦  Ash of War: Through and Through  ♦  Ash of War: Thunderbolt  ♦  Ash of War: Troll's Roar  ♦  Ash of War: Unsheathe  ♦  Ash of War: Vacuum Slice  ♦  Ash of War: Vow of the Indomitable  ♦  Ash of War: War Cry  ♦  Ash of War: Waves of Darkness  ♦  Ash of War: White Shadow's Lure  ♦  Ash of War: Wild Strikes  ♦  Lost Ashes of War  ♦  Messages\n\n
