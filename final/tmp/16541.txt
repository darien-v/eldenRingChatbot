The Stormhawk Axe scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good weapon for users who want to engage enemies in close combat with slashing attacks, with the addition of lightning damage.\n\nBattle axe designed to resemble a hawk, with its wings comprising the blade. Signature weapon of warriors who strive to remain one with the storm, despite being so far from their place of birth.\nTheir hearts are proud, and thereby easily undone.\n\nWhere to Find Stormhawk Axe in Elden Ring\nThe Stormhawk Axe weapon can be found at the following location:\n\n2x looted from Nepheli Loux at the Village of the Albinaurics in Western Liurnia of the Lakes. [Map Link] \n\nYou must first talk to Nepheli Loux in her first location, and exhaust her father's dialog options and then hers in the round table to get her to move to the pathway under the bridge. This is to get her to move to the location. You can slay her in her first location and get the axes as well. It is also possible to bait the enemies to attack her in her first location, in which she doesn't retaliate against the enemies.\n\n2x left by Nepheli Loux at the Roundtable Hold in the room outside the library.\n\nFor the axes to be left at this location, Nepheli's quest must not be advanced, preventing her from leaving the room until after the Roundtable starts burning. At which point, Nepheli will be absent and the two axes will be left where she stood.\n\nLooted from a dead body in the courtyard with Iron Maidens near Fortified Manor, First Floor at Leyndell, Royal Capital. [Map Link]\nCastle Sol: 1x found on a corpse on a wooden awning in the central building of the courtyard. To reach this, head north while hugging the western ramparts from the castle's Main Entrance. Look for a room inside the ramparts near the northern section. This room has several slimes and a ladder. Climb the ladder to get on top of the ramparts and follow it west to a wooden bridge that connects to the central building. Beware the spectral Exile enemies mounted on ballistae on the ramparts, as well as the central building. Once on the central building's roof, jump on top of the cluttered objects draped in cloth in the northeastern section so you can get over the wall onto the awning and collect the axe.
