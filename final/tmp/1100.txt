It is said that she took the form of a human to commune with the knights as a priestess of the ancient dragon cult.\n\nElden Ring Ancient Dragon Lansseax Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Abandoned Coffin / Rampartside Path\nWhen fought by the Abandoned Coffin Site of Grace, Lansseax will retreat once her health reaches 80%. She does not need to be defeated here to appear by the Rampartside Path Site of Grace. However making her retreat does reduce her health for the Rampartside Path fight.\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Ancient Dragon Lansseax Location\n\nFrom the Abandoned Coffin Site of Grace, head up the hill and Lansseax will fly down and attack you. [Map Link]\nFrom the Rampartside Path Site of Grace, take the path up the hill, then double back to the eastern edge of the ridge where she'll fly down and attack you.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 556 / 846 / 1303\nScarlet Rot: 556 / 846 / 1303\nHemorrhage: 556 / 846 / 1303\nFrostbite: 556 / 846 / 1303\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

Summon her far away from the boss and draw its attention away from her. She will deal steady damage to the boss but is quite frail and will not survive long if the boss is focused on her.Another good alternative is the Ancestral Follower.\nUse the Shard Spiral spell, as her large hitbox means that the attack can land multiple times. \nBring some Lightningproof Dried Liver and Boiled Crab for damage negation.\nTurn off camera lock, as it can only lock onto the head and body of the dragon, which can be very disorienting.\n\nMelee Users\nWhen facing this boss, do not take the lightning attacks lightly since they have the ability to one-shot players. While in the air, you may see a resemblance of a weapon made with lightning. At this point you need to back up to prepare to jump over this weapon attack or dodge. Ideally stay on higher or lower ground so you can go over or under some its attacks. For greater speed, you may want to consider seeing this fight through while on Torrent so you can be quick in disengaging when needed. This way you can wait for openings and also quickly run in with Torrent for a quick hit and escape if needed. This will lessen the chances of getting stepped on than if you were to run in on foot. While on Torrent, it will also give you enough time to run away from any anticipated fire attacks or landing spaces. \nFor attacks, Torrent will also be beneficial for reaching her head for attacks with his higher jumps, especially on higher ground. The main melee strategy is to keep moving and a combination of looking for openings to run in for a few hits and then running back out to repeat the process. \nMagic and Ranged Users\nWith ranged attack, and a big field going against a dragon with large range, it is still recommended to use Torrent for this fight to quickly cover distances either for escaping an attack or running in for a better angle.  Lots of the dragon's attack cover a large AoE. You will need to continuously disengage and move around to stay out of her line of sight and give yourself a better position to deal attacks. For range, it is a combination or circling back, stopping to get an angle and dealing an attack while anticipating her next attack and being prepared to back away. This may make it more difficult to aim with smaller ranged spells and attacks so you may still need to use Torrent to approach and get better angle to hit. \nIf you keep moving, there is a chance she will constantly be trying to turn towards you and repositioning rather than dealing attacks, which will give you more opportunities to keep attacking while moving until she is eventually cleared.\n\nAncient Dragon Lansseax Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nLansseax’s Glaive (slam)\n  Lansseax stands onto her hind legs and raises her left arm. A massive bolt of red lightning appears in her grip. Lansseax then slams the lightning across the ground from her right to her left, releasing waves of lightning forwards across the ground. This attack will knock you to the ground if the initial lightning bolt connects. Note that both the slamming and sweeping glaive share the same windup animation; which attack is used is determined by how far the player is from Lansseax. The slam is used while relatively far away, while the sweep occurs if the player is too close. \n  Dodge forwards through the attack and hit Lansseax's momentarily vulnerable head. \n\nLansseax’s Glaive (sweep)\n Lansseax stands onto her hind legs and raises her left arm. A massive bolt of red lightning appears in her grip. Lansseax then sweeps the lightning across the ground from her right to her left, releasing waves of lightning forwards across the ground and jumping backwards as she does. This attack will knock you to the ground if the initial lightning bolt connects. Note that both the slamming and sweeping glaive share the same windup animation; which attack is used is determined by how far the player is from Lansseax. The slam is used while relatively far away, while the sweep occurs if the player is too close. \n Prevent this attack from occurring by moving backwards in order to trigger the slam instead. If she does use it, roll forwards through the sweep and pursue Lansseax.\n\nAerial Glaive \n This attack is only used by the miniboss version in Crumbling Farum Azula. The dragon leaps backwards into the air and raises their left hand. A massive bolt of red lightning appears in their grip. The dragon then sweeps the bolt vertically downwards beneath and in front of themself before landing. \nRun diagonally forwards towards the dragon and attack their head when they land.\n\nAncient Dragons’ Lightning Strike\n This attack is only used once by Lansseax, immediately after landing to begin the battle. The miniboss version in Crumbling Farum Azula will use it multiple times. Lansseax raises her head and wings and roars loudly. Many glowing red patches appear on the ground around her, and a few seconds later red lightning strikes them.  \nSpring forwards towards Lansseax's right claw (your left). Stand in front and slightly towards the midline of her body, and wait until she begins lowering her head. Then, begin a charged heavy attack. This will hit her snout as she lowers it, dealing bonus damage.\n\nClaw Combo\n Lansseax raises her left arm and slams it down in front of her at an angle, such that her hand passes below her chin. She then pulls it back in a swipe from her right to her left. Both attacks cause small lightning explosions along the path of the attack a few moments after it completes. This combo will knock you to the ground if it connects with one of the physical attacks.  Follows: none Followed by: right swipe, rearing firebreath \nRoll backwards and immediately roll again to dodge the first swipe and its lightning trail, then repeat the process for the second hit. Roll early through the attacks to have time to dodge the trail, and note that if you are hit by the first swipe's trail, the second swipe's trail cannot be avoided with a roll because you will be forced to roll late on the second swing, thereby preventing you from recovering fast enough to roll again.\n\nRight Swipe\n Lansseax raises her right arm and swipes it from her right to her left, causing a trail of lightning explosions in the path of the swing moments later. This attack will knock the player to the ground if the physical portion connects. Follows: claw combo, single bite, double bite (phase 2 only), vertical slam (phase 2 only) Followed by: vertical slam, rearing firebreath, repositioning hop, reverse right swipe (only if standing behind Lansseax and to her right) \nDodge backwards once to dodge the swipe and then immediately do so again to dodge the trail. Prepare for the potential followup.\n\nVertical Slam\n Lansseax rises to her hindlegs and raises her left arm above her head. After a brief delay, she falls forwards and slams her right hand into the ground, releasing a small electrical burst around the point of impact. This attack will knock the player to the ground if it connects. Follows: right swipe Followed by: right swipe (phase 2 only), rearing firebreath (phase 2 only), double bite (phase 2 only) \nMove backwards and roll once to the left. If performed correctly, you will roll to the right side of her head (left from your perspective) and be out of range of the electrical burst. Then, attack her head, remembering that this attack can be comboed into further moves in phase 2.\n\nDouble Bite\nLansseax rises to her hindlegs, arches her neck to her right and opens her mouth, then bites forward. She then repeats the process with her neck arched to her left. Follows: vertical slam (phase 2 only) Followed by: rearing firebreath, right swipe (phase 2 only)\nSprint out of range of the first bite, and charge a heavy attack as Lansseax bites a second time. As she finishes, release the heavy attack and hit her head. This is a safe punish in both phase 1 and phase 2 if performed properly.\n\nSingle Bite\nLansseax arches her neck to her left, then bites forwards without coming off the ground. Follows: none Followed by: right swipe, rearing firebreath\nRoll backwards and right through the bite, and prepare for the followup. Additionally, be aware of the possibility of this move; even though Lansseax does not chain into it, it has fast startup and recovery that can lead to it being used surprisingly quickly after another attack or a non-chained followup being performed earlier than expected.\n\nRearing Firebreath\nLansseax rises onto her hind legs and arches her neck before spewing fire forwards. She then sweeps the fire under her body from her right to her left, and finishes the attack by spewing fire forwards again. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects. Follows: single bite, double bite, right swipe, claw combo, vertical slam (phase 2 only) Followed by: none\nSprinting forwards or riding Torrent will allow you to reach Lansseax's tail. Stand far back along it, and attack it as she breathes fire, using thrusting attacks if available to take advantage of the counter state. If you have access to long ranged attacks, you can move backwards out of reach and attack. Otherwise, sprint backwards and to your left. As Lansseax finishes sweeping the fire from her right to her left and transitions into the forwards gout, sprint forwards towards her head and attack it once as it lands. The timing and positioning are very tight; you may simply wish to wait the attack out, especially if there is any uneven terrain in the area.\n\nForward Firebreath\n This attack is often used when the player is far from Lansseax and in front of her. Lansseax arches her neck slightly, then exhales a long stream of fire forwards, sweeping slightly from her right to her left. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects.\n Summon Torrent and ride diagonally forwards to your right. Note that unlike the similar looking attack from flying-dragon model enemies, this attack does not track the player.\n\nAerial Firebreath\nThis is often used when the player is standing under Lansseax's chest. She crouches down, then launches backwards into flight as flame particles appear in her mouth. Lansseax then spits a gout of fire onto the ground at the player and flaps backwards to land.\nRun backwards out of range of the fire, then sprint forwards either on foot or Torrent to close the gap once more.\n\nLightning Slam\nThis attack is often used when the player is standing under Lansseax. Lansseax rises to her hind legs and raises both arms. After a brief delay, she slams both claws into the ground under her chest, creating a large shockwave that will knock you to the ground if it connects. Waves of lightning propagate outwards from the point of impact as the shockwave dissipates.\nMove out from under Lansseax, then sprint back in after she slams, rolling through the waves of lightning as you do. Lansseax is vulnerable for a significant period following this attack.\n\nReverse Right Swipe\nThis attack is only used if the player is standing at Lansseax's right side after she has used a right swipe. Lansseax pulls her hand backwards from her left to her right in a swipe, leaving a trail of lightning which erupts moments later as she does. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects.\nAvoid standing at Lansseax's right side. If unavoidable, roll through the attack and then roll again to avoid the lightning, or sprint/roll forwards under Lansseax and out of reach.\n\nRepositioning Claw Swipe\nThis attack is commonly used when the player is standing at Lansseax's left side. Lansseax raises her left arm and swipes from her right to her left, turning to face the player in the process. This attack will knock the player to the ground if it connects, and leaves a trail of lightning that activates after a momentary delay.\nSprint backwards and out of range of the attack, or roll early through the claw swipe in order to have enough time to roll again immediately after and dodge the lightning.\n\nWing Beating\nThis attack is often used when the player is under Lansseax. Lansseax rises onto her hind legs and flaps her wings three times, staggering players caught under her. She then flaps a fourth time, knocking players to the ground if they do not dodge. This attack does not deal damage, only stuns.\nMove out from under Lansseax, and sprint in to attack once she flaps for a fourth time. Alternatively, dodge through each flap and attack after she completes the fourth.\n\nTail Swipe\nThis attack is often used when the player is behind Lansseax. Lansseax raises her tail and bends it to her left, then swings herself counterclockwise  around to face the player, sweeping the area behind and to the side as she does. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects.\nDodge through the attack, or sprint out of range. Alternatively, jump over the attack with Torrent.\n\nDivebomb\n This attack is only used by the miniboss version found in Crumbling Faram Azula. The dragon launches itself backwards into the air, hangs there for a moment, and then dives towards the player. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects. \nDodge forwards through the dive and attack the dragon's hind legs.\n\nRepositioning Hop\n Lansseax leaps forwards and glides a short distance, turning around as she lands. If she happens to land on a player, it will deal heavy damage and knock them to the ground. Follows: any attack which a rearing firebreath could Followed by: none \nTurn around and pursue Lansseax. If it looks like Lansseax might land on you, get out of the way.\n\nAncient Dragon Lansseax Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nLansseax can be struck by the lightning near the Fulgurblooms on the plateau, taking 20 damage in the process.\nLansseax's moveset is limited compared to the miniboss variant found in Crumbling Farum Azula; she uses neither the divebomb nor the aerial lightning glaive, and will only use her Lightning Strike attack once as a scripted opener instead of throughout the battle.\nKnown as Lansseax, Ancient Dragon Progeny in 1.00 version of the game\n\nAncient Dragon Lansseax Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
