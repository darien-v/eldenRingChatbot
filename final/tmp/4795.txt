Spirit of a mad soldier with a large, brawny physique. Though he has stifled his panic within the dark confines of his helmet, he rampages as if driven mad when agitated by bloodshed or the humming of insects. This mad soldier is all that is left of a broken gladiator. \n\nMad Pumpkin Head Ashes Location in Elden Ring\nMad Pumpkin Head Ashes can be found in the following location:\n\nDropped by the Erdtree Burial Watchdog (Duo) bosses at the end of the Minor Erdtree Catacombs. [Map Link]\n\nElden Ring Mad Pumpkin Head Ashes Guide\n\nCosts high FP (110)\nHis flail strikes build up bleed.\nHis large head is extremely resistant to all forms of damage, a trait shared with the enemy he is modeled after.\nHe will temporarily freak out if anything nearby (including himself) is inflicted with Blood Loss. This involves him smashing his head around aimlessly for a time, then looking toward the sky contemplatively for a few seconds before returning to their normal state. This tantrum is not triggered by the Blood Loss caused by the Ash of War Seppuku. The head slamming he does during this tantrum period cannot damage the player, but it can cause the player to stagger if they are struck.\nIt appears that, currently, bug enemies that are nearby do not have any noteworthy effect on this spirit, despite the description of his spirit ashes. Which would be ironic if this was caused by a bug itself.\nThis (Summon Variant) is smaller in stature compared to Boss & Non-Boss Variants.\n\nElden Ring Spirits\n\nAlbinauric Ashes  ♦  Ancestral Follower Ashes  ♦  Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff Ashes  ♦  Archer Ashes  ♦  Avionette Soldier Ashes  ♦  Azula Beastman Ashes  ♦  Banished Knight Engvall Ashes  ♦  Banished Knight Oleg Ashes  ♦  Battlemage Hugues Ashes  ♦  Blackflame Monk Amon Ashes  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Floh  ♦  Clayman Ashes  ♦  Cleanrot Knight Finlay Ashes  ♦  Crystalian Ashes  ♦  Demi-Human Ashes  ♦  Depraved Perfumer Carmaan Ashes  ♦  Dolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet  ♦  Dung Eater Puppet  ♦  Fanged Imp Ashes  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet  ♦  Fire Monk Ashes  ♦  Giant Rat Ashes  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Godrick Soldier Ashes  ♦  Greatshield Soldier Ashes  ♦  Haligtree Soldier Ashes  ♦  Jarwight Puppet  ♦  Kindred of Rot Ashes  ♦  Land Squirt Ashes  ♦  Latenna The Albinauric  ♦  Leyndell Soldier Ashes  ♦  Lhutel the Headless  ♦  Lone Wolf Ashes  ♦  Man-Serpent Ashes  ♦  Marionette Soldier Ashes  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier Ashes  ♦  Mimic Tear Ashes  ♦  Miranda Sprout Ashes  ♦  Nepheli Loux Puppet  ♦  Nightmaiden & Swordstress Puppets  ♦  Noble Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Nomad Ashes  ♦  Omenkiller Rollo  ♦  Oracle Envoy Ashes  ♦  Page Ashes  ♦  Perfumer Tricia Ashes  ♦  Putrid Corpse Ashes  ♦  Radahn Soldier Ashes  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier Ashes  ♦  Redmane Knight Ogha Ashes  ♦  Rotten Stray Ashes  ♦  Skeletal Bandit Ashes  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman Ashes  ♦  Soldjars of Fortune Ashes  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish Ashes  ♦  Stormhawk Deenh  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Vulgar Militia Ashes  ♦  Wandering Noble Ashes  ♦  Warhawk Ashes  ♦  Winged Misbegotten Ashes\n\n
