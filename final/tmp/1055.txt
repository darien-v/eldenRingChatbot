Success in this battle hinges on your ability to manage the two very dangerous knights. Niall himself doesn't get too dangerous until the knights are defeated. He will lumber around the arena, making no real effort to close the distance so focus on the knights at the beginning. Of the two, the dual sword knight is the most aggressive and dangerous. It is highly recommended that you summon a tanky spirit to more easily manage both knights at once. They are also susceptible to Magic Damage so Sorcery mains should have a slight advantage damage-wise.\nThe easiest way to be rid of the Banished Knights is to, immediately, after traversing the fog, run into the right-hand corner of the arena and await the charge of the dual-wielding Knight, and using a Bewitching Branch on him, turning him into an ally (it might take a few tries to get the timing right, the animation is rather long). This will cause the sword-n-board Banished Knight to immediately aggro him, while your new ally attacks Niall himself, ripping away a huge chunk of his health. Bewitch the second Banished Knight, while avoiding Niall's windstorm attacks, back away and summon your spirit ashes and apply any buff you need. Niall should have taken out both knights by this point (he kills them extremely quickly), or they will have brought him below 50% health, at which point they will despawn, as Niall enters his second phase.\nOnce the knights are killed, Niall begins actively pursuing you and using his more dangerous moves. Niall commands the powers of Ice via a whirlwind he summons around him, as well as Lightning via infusions on his prosthetic leg. Niall's most dangerous moves always involve him summoning whirlwinds of frost around him. He can then follow up with a stomp of his peg leg, infusing it with lightning and then leaping towards you to perform a powerful leg smash that creates a lightning shockwave on impact. He can also follow-up with two versions of a dash attack. The first is a single whirl of his halberd followed by a quick dash into an uppercut with his halberd. The second version sees Niall charging up for a few seconds as he sucks in frosty winds towards him, he then whirls his halberd several times, creating an expanding whirlwind of frost. Finally, he dashes to the side and then runs toward you, culminating in an uppercut with his halberd. This move tires Niall out and he will be kneeling and vulnerable for several seconds. This is the biggest damage window throughout his fight so be sure to dodge the uppercut and get as many hits in as possible as he recovers.\nMelee Users\nStart with heavy R2 On right summon dual wielding knight, the attack should land at or just before he materializes. Then a second heavy R2, and he should stagger. If lucky, you can get a crit in which should kill him at appropriate level for this boss and you will be invulnerable. Roll away and or heal. Next bait out the 2nd summon and do a running R2, back up, rinse and repeat. If he teleports to you, roll behind him. Be selective. Running R2 should bait him into an attack and an auto stagger when he is walking with his shield up. You have plenty of time on the 2nd summon as the boss will be passive during this phase.\nNext the Commander Niall will charge up frost and electric attacks after his summons have died. Roll at the last second for his attacks. When he charges his leg and flip kicks, roll to his right (your left) to get an opening for an attack. He does a delayed heavy swing after one consecutive attack he has where you should roll twice in a row to dodge it every time, and then punish him accordingly with a few swings. When he does a frost wind and then a charged electric attack, dodge roll into a single r1, watch for a quick poke and then a heavy telegraphed swing, again rolling to your left. Now the charged electric stomp AOE, difficult to manage and hard to avoid. With the swinging frost winds, he has multiple attacks that look similar to this. The one you're looking for is a melee attack ending that you can punish. The other frost AOE should be avoided. So just manage close range and then outside his AOE blasts. Managing your distance and opportunities is key. You should stay up close to him and back away when you see a frost swing coming. Upon one of his charged frost and electric attacks he will kneel and pause for a huge opportunity to hit him with heavy R2s, you should be able to stun him and deal a crit. Definitely dealing with the summons without getting hit was a big advantage to have as much flasks as possible to fight him, because his electric AOE stomp is near impossible to avoid when up close. After frost winds, be ready to charge in.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor magic and ranged users, you would want to equip a heavy-hitting spell/incantation for this fight. As stated above, defeat the two knights first before engaging Commander Niall. For a bow and arrow user, try equipping arrows or bolts that has status effects on them like bleed or rot. \nIf you have the Comet Azur spell, cast a Terra Magica at the edge of the Mist gate (make sure the knight outside the arena is already killed), consume a Flask of Wondrous Physick with a Cerulean Hidden Tear to nullify FP consumption. Once you enter the boss arena, immediately lock on to Commander Niall then charge and release your Comet Azure. It is also recommended to add a Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear besides the Cerulean Hidden Tear for increased magic damage. This setup will most likely one-shot Commander Niall, even on higher NG+ playthroughs.\n\nCommander Niall Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nCall Spirits - Banished Knights\nAt the beginning of the fight, he will wave his standard and summon two Banished Knights. While they are alive, he will continuously buff them until they die or he reaches half health.\nFocus the dual-wielding knight, as it is the most aggressive. Use a Bewitching Branch on one if you have the materials.\n\nHalberd Combo\nA standard 3-hit combo beginning with a stab, a low sweep and ending with a slow overhead smash.\nGet some distance away from him or dodge each attack. The final hit is charged exceedingly slow so beware of timing or simply run away.\n\nStorm Kick\nNiall stomps his prosthetic leg on the ground, creating a frost whirlwind around him and infusing the leg with lightning. He then leaps up towards you and after a short delay, crashes down, releasing a lightning shockwave a small radius from the point of impact.\nMaintain distance during the whirlwind to prevent getting frosted. Once he leaps, wait for him to drop before dodging.\n\nStorm Kick (Ground)\nNiall raises his prosthetic leg up high in front of him, infusing it with lightning and then stomps down in front of him, releasing a lightning shockwave from the point of impact.\nTime your dodge very well, especially if he raises his leg up high as the shockwave released has a massive radius. You can alternatively jump to avoid damage.\n\nWhirlwind Dash\nNiall twirls his halberd once, creating a whirlwind of frost around him. He then dashes straight towards you and performs an uppercut with the halberd.\nThe dash itself does no damage but serves to throw you off your dodge timing. Dodge the uppercut instead.\n\nWhirlwind Dash (Charged)\nNiall turns his back towards you and charges up, sucking in frosty winds towards him. He then twirls his halberd several times, releasing an expanding whirlwind of frost. Niall dashes to the side and then runs towards you, culminating in an uppercut with his halberd. Note that sometimes, he only performs the charging portion of this move, without the whirlwind release nor the dash. The frosty winds can still inflict Frostbite on you so maintain distance.\nMaintain distance as he is charging and releasing the whirlwinds. Beware their expanding radius that covers most of the arena. When he dashes towards you, wait til the uppercut before dodging. Successfully dodging this attack tires Niall out, rendering him vulnerable for a very long time. This is your biggest damage window for him.\n\nCommander Niall Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nHis armour set can be purchased from Finger Reader Enia after killing him: the Veteran's Set\nThe name "Niall" is a first name of Scottish-Gaelic or Irish-Gaelic origin with unclear meaning. Presumed meanings are "cloud", "chivalrous" or "victorious". All of these meanings make sense for the character being a military commander wielding weather-themed powers.\nThough their relationship is unconfirmed, Commander O'Neil, uses the same model as him, same voice actor, same armour and Commander's Standard and the same first phase moveset, down to summoning disgraced warriors (Exile Soldiers in O'Neil's case), with the lone exception that O'Neil whips up Scarlet Rot winds versus Niall's blizzards. \n\n"O'Neil" means "Son of Neil", with "Neil" being a variation of the name "Niall".\nBoth have an implied connection to the twin demigods Miquella and Malenia; O'Neil carries the Unalloyed Gold Needle made by Miquella and the Commander's Standard references his former master being Malenia, while Niall protects the Haligtree Secret Medallion (left). The Veteran's Armor cape also features a red cloth similar to that of Malenia's Armor, down to Miquella's unalloyed gold wreath being embroided onto it.\n\nNiall's presence at Castle Sol also implies a connection to Godwyn the Golden and the eclipse worshipped there that will allegedly resurrect his soul. Niall wielding lightning powers and the dragon-themed decorations on the Veteran's Set may imply he was a Dragon Cult Knight in service to Godwyn before the latter's death.\n\nCommander Niall Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
