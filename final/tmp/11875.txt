They have tough outer shells and a giant pincer arm adept at crushing unfortunate prey and an equally big needle arm perfect for impaling any target it chooses.\n\nElden Ring Giant Crayfish Locations\nWhere to Find Giant Crayfish:\n\nMarshes and shallows of Liurnia of the Lakes.\nA Grafted Scion that drops Larval Tear is disguised as a Giant Crayfish patrolling around the gazebo between Rose Church and Boilprawn Shack. There are four Giant Crayfish in this area, three of them are sleeping and one is patrolling. The disguised Grafted Scion is the one patrolling. Easily reached by: \n\nGoing south from Fallen Ruins of the Lake site of grace, or\nGoing northeast from Folly on the Lake site of grace, or\nGoing northwest from Boilprawn Shack site of grace. [Elden Ring Map Link]\n\nLower area of Subterranean Shunning-Grounds.\nFreezing Lake in the Mountaintops of the Giants.\n\nElden Ring Giant Crayfish Combat Information\n\nHealth: \n\n1,985 HP (Liurnia of the Lakes - Foot of the Four Belfries)\n4,803 HP (Subterranean Shunning-Grounds)\n1,985 HP (Liurnia of the Lakes - Folly on the Lake, South Rose Church)\n1,985 HP (Liurnia of the Lakes - Testu's Rise)\n4,243 HP (Mountaintops of the Giants)\n\nPoise: 80\n\nValues in Red correspond to the Mountaintops of the Giants variant.\n\nABSORPTIONS\n\nPhy (Standard): 10\nPhy (Slash): 35\nPhy (Strike): 0\nPhy (Pierce): 10 || 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20 || (-20)\nLightning: 20 || (0)\nHoly: 20\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if an absorption is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nRESISTANCES\n\nPoison: 324 - 343\nScarlet Rot: 324 - 343\nHemorrhage: 324 - 343\nFrostbite: 176 - 187 || IMMUNE\nSleep: 176 - 187\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nGiant Crayfish Attacks and Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter \n\nNeedle Jab\nThe crayfish bring its needle arm back then jabs it forward after a potentially small delay. It can do this attack up to 3 times in a row. (Needs confirmation via analysis and testing.)\n As soon as you see the needle arm go back, dodge roll to your right if you are close, and dodge away from the crayfish if you are further away. If you are close, dodge right, end up near the left side of its head and it is still doing needle attacks, you can safely attack it. NEVER dodge to the left for this attack, or any other needle attack except Jumping Needle Crash because of the positioning of the needle arm on its body. \n\nRetreating Needle Jab\nThe crayfish readies it's needle arm by drawing it backwards then jabs it forward exactly once. However, as it jabs, it walks very quickly away from you and distances itself. The crayfish brings it's needle arm closer to it's body than the other needle attacks usually as it telegraphs it.\n As soon as you see the needle arm go back, dodge roll to your right if you are close, and dodge either away or towards it if you are further away. It is very difficult to counterattack immediately after, especially with a melee weapon, due to the nature of its 'retreat' while the crayfish is jabbing. \n\nSuper Needle Combo\nThe crayfish does a short telegraph of it readying its needle arm backwards then jabbing it forward anywhere between 1 - 6 times in quick succession. The crayfish can use any other needle arm attack except Jumping Needle Crash at any time during this attack to end the combo, with the only exception to this being Pincer Swipe. It can also end the combo prematurely without doing another needle attack.\n As soon as you see the needle arm go back, dodge roll directly AWAY from the crayfish if you are over 3 metres away from its head and stay back until you see it stop jabbing its needle arm or use another attack. If you are closer when this attack is about to happen, dodge roll to your RIGHT and a little bit towards the crayfish if you aren't already practically touching it. Keep rolling, sprinting or otherwise moving to your right until this attack combo finishes. You can also safely attack while it is doing the attack if you are at the left side of it's head. No matter which method of dodging you do, do NOT dodge to your left, since that will make you almost guaranteed to hit you due to the position of the needle arm on the crayfish's body. \n\nJumping Needle Crash\nThe crayfish jumps high into the air then lands back down onto the ground, slamming it's needle arm into the ground in the process. The recovery time after this attack is the easiest time to get lots of and/or powerful hits in as not only is that time long, but also the crayfish is incapable of doing any attacks until after it frees it's needle from the ground and after it has recovered after stumbling backwards slightly.\nWhen you see the crayfish jump then stops gaining further altitude, dodge roll INTO it if you want to punish this attack with melee weapons but you should dodge roll AWAY if you want to use long-range spells. This is the best time to unleash your most slow but powerful attacks, skills or spells, such as charged heavy attacks, Comet Azur, and so on.\n\nPincer Swipe\nThe crayfish moves it's pincer arm up and back then swipes it at its front to your left. This attack has a high chance of getting followed-up by Returning Pincer Swipe if you are close and in front of the crayfish.\nWhen you see the pincer arm dip very slightly after getting brought up and back, dodge roll in any direction except left. If immediately after the swipe, the crayfish doesn't do the Returning Pincer Swipe attack, you can safely punish this attack once or twice, depending on your weapon's speed.\n\nPincer Slam\nThe crayfish raises it's pincer arm then slams it down. Occasionally uses the Returning Pincer Swipe attack as a follow-up, but only if you are still in front of it after the slam and happens much more rarely than after the Pincer Swipe attack.\nImmediately after the pincer arm begins to stop rising, dodge roll. If you don't the risk of the crayfish to follow-up with Returning Pincer Swipe, roll to either side, though ideally to your right because of the needle arm. Even if it does follow-up, a very fast weapon such as a dagger can get a light attack on the crayfish between this attack and the follow-up, but it is still risky to do so.\n\nSwiping Pincer Grab\nThe crayfish raises the front of it's body while slowly raising it's pincer arm. After approximately 3 seconds, the pincer arm swipes in front the crayfish to try to get you in it's grasp. If it succeeds, it will follow up with 4 undodgeable needle arm jabs.\nPay very close attention to the pincer. As soon as you see the pincer (Not the arm) increase in speed as it raises, dodge roll in any direction. The tell for this is quite subtle so try to position yourself so you can see the pincer. You could also land some hits on the crayfish itself as it is charging up this attack, as it takes very long before the actual grab comes. Depending on your weapon, you might get away with doing one or two light attacks immediately after the grab while it is recovering.\n\nReturning Pincer Swipe\nAfter doing either the Pincer Swipe or Pincer Slam attack, the crayfish can follow up with this attack, when, from the position of its pincer arm after doing Pincer Swipe or Pincer Slam, it moves its pincer slightly towards itself and to its right (Away from you and to the left in your perspective) then swings its pincer arm fast to your right. Never does this attack on its own.\nIf you see the crayfish moving its pincer like that, dodge roll in any direction except your right. Alternatively, the crayfish will never do this attack if after Pincer Swipe or Pincer Slam, you are anything except close and in front area of the pincer arm. However, if it does do this follow up attack, it may be better to dodge towards or away from it, since dodging to the left may put you at a risk of getting hit by the crayfish's needle attacks.\n\nBubbles\nThe crayfish raises front of it's body high then spits bubbles in a very small area at the ground directly in front of it. Only does this attack if you are very close to it and directly in front of its face.\nDodge roll either to the side or directly away from the crayfish, as the area of effect for this attack is small. The telegraph is fairly similar to the Swiping Pincer Grab attack except for this attack, its body rises faster. \n\nLobster Sniper\nThis is easily the most infamous attack that the crayfish does, it suddenly raises the front part of it's body and both its needle arm and pincer arm high then shoots water at you with surprisingly high speed and accuracy from its mouth. Only does this attack when far away.\n A second after you see the crayfish's frontal part of it's body and arms rise fast and high, roll to either side. The telegraph for this attack is somewhat similar to the Bubbles attack, except the limbs are raised considerably higher. Despite it's reputation, the attack isn't as bad as it seems, as it can be easily dodge rolled with enough practise and the crayfish never does this attack at melee range. It is only really dangerous when you are riding Torrent and/or caught unawares.\n\nElden Ring Giant Crayfish Drops\n\n Item \n Drop Rate \n Additional Info \n\nRunes\n100%\n 500 - 2374\n\nStrip of White Flesh\n100%\nN/A\n\nCrab Eggs\n25.00%\nN/A\n\nSmithing Stone [2]\n10.00%\nN/A\n\nRimed Crystal Bud\n50.00%\nN/A\n\nRunes: \n\n500  (Liurnia of the Lakes - Foot of the Four Belfries)\n2,374  (Subterranean Shunning-Grounds)\n540  (Liurnia of the Lakes - Foot of the Four Belfries)\n515  (Liurnia of the Lakes - Testu's Rise)\n2,287  (Mountaintops of the Giants)\n\nGiant Crayfish Notes & Tips\n\nCan be staggered and riposted after being hit on the head a few times.
