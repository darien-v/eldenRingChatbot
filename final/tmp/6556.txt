Comet Azur spell creates a giant comet that deals very high damage from a great distance.\n\nLegendary sorcery devised by Azur, primeval sorcerer.\nFires a tremendous comet in a torrent akin to the distant starry expanse, the place said to be the origin of glintstone.Hold to continue releasing the sorcery's power.\nWhen Azur glimpsed into the primeval current, he saw darkness. He was left both bewitched and fearful of the abyss.\n\nWhere to find Comet Azur\nWhere to find Comet Azur:\n\n Hermit Village in Mt. Gelmir: Acquired from Primeval Sorcerer Azur sitting near the cliffs in the northeast. [Map Link] \n\nElden Ring Comet Azur Notes & Tips\n\nOnce cast, the player channels for approximately 3 seconds and fires a very long beam-like comet dealing magic damage to all enemies on the way. The player can keep channelling to continue firing the comet, draining large amount of Focus Points. Once cast, the direction of the beam cannot be adjusted. \n\nEnd of beam is capable of flinching/knocking lesser enemies\nBeam itself deals low stance/guard damage\n\nAI acts weird, when facing this spell as they roll around sometimes even into beam  They react to casting animation, not what this animation creates, thus making Comet Azur somewhat usable against bosses that can dodge, most notably Tarnished-type enemies (but to a limited degree)  \n\nThere is an exception in this behaviour in form of Malenia, Blade of Miquella, as she dodges away from this spell and tries to approach the caster from save path.\n\nThis spell is channelled, not charged, and therefore does not benefit from Godfrey Icon.\nIts damage can be boosted by 15% by wearing Azur's Glintstone Crown. This comes at the cost of a 15% increase to ALL sorcery costs.\nVery slow casting time, that can be easily stopped. \n\nAzur's Glintstone Staff combined with Radagon Icon shortens cast time significantly at a cost of increased FP consumption, what can be mitigated with Primal Glintstone Blade.\n\nCerulean Hidden Tear allows the player to continue channelling without consuming FP, as spell has no stamina consumption outside first part of the spell.\nThis spell has the third highest Intelligence requirement of all sorceries. In exchange, it is capable of dealing massive amounts of damage from long-range to targets that stand on the comet. Due to its very high FP consumption, the player will require high levels of Mind or usage of the Cerulean Hidden Tear to make the most of this sorcery. As the beam cannot be adjusted once cast, this spell will only work against slow-moving enemies or very large ones, such as Mogh, Lord of Blood, or Erdtree Avatars.\n\nBest Comet Azur Buffs\nUse these Buffs to maximize the performance of the Comet Azur spell.

Use Comet Azur against slow-moving or large bosses like Mogh by exploiting its high long-range damage potential and stall bosses that can dodge attacks by casting the spell.
