\n\n Nokron, Eternal City \n\nNokron, Eternal City Map & Fragments\nSites of Grace & Sub-Locations\nAll NPCs & Merchants\nAll Items, Equipment & Magic\nAll Enemies & Bosses\n\nNokron, Eternal City is a Location in Elden Ring. The Nokron, Eternal City region is a sprawling city ruin located a level above the Siofra River. Much like the Siofra River, this underground region has features that you could mistake for an overland area - the fauna, growing vegetation, and a sky seemingly filled with stars. You can reach this area by going down Starfall Crater in southern Mistwood created by a falling star after you've defeated Starscourge Radahn. See below for the location the meteor falls on your map.\nTechnically, using the Nokron, Eternal City Waygate found at The Four Belfries in  Liurnia of the Lakes takes you to Nokron. Elden Ring Interactive Map Link (This requires a Imbued Sword Key). However, note that the Nokron, Eternal City Waygate just sends you to a small part of the map with an optional battle against a Lesser Crucible Knight. The full map is only accessible after defeating Starscourge Radahn.\n\nAn ancient city punished for high treason against the Greater Will\n\nNokron, Eternal City Map & Map Fragments\n\nNo Map Fragments: Nokron, Eternal City shares a map with Siofra River.\n[Elden Ring Map here]\n\n Location on the Map (Only accessible after defeating Starscourge Radahn):\n\nElden Ring Nokron, Eternal City Sites of Grace & Sub-Locations\nSites of Grace\n\nAncestral Woods.

Head back to Mistwood and make your way south until you find Starfall Crater in the area west of Fort Haight. You have to jump down into the crater to get there but at a specific spot. Just randomly jumping down into the hole can get you killed. Descend the crater using platforms found on the eastern side of the crater and eventually, you'll arrive at Nokron, Eternal City. On the way, make sure to keep an eye out for corpses that have a Golden Rune (5) and two Soporific Grease on them.\nAt this point, you're just in the outskirts of Nokron. This Eternal City shares a map fragment with Siofra River, so navigating this area may get confusing; even opening your map right now shows you're outside of the map. From here though, getting to the main part of the city is pretty straightforward - head northeast to a toppled over building, noting a Rune Arc can be found on a corpse laying up on a roof of a building in the south. Head north scaling up the building, and go through one of the windows on the side of the standing building that opens into a cavern. Before dropping down to where the Fallen Hawks Soldiers are, make sure to loot the corpses on this ledge for a Furlcalling Finger Remedy and a Smithing Stone (5). After clearing out the enemies and collecting the Ghost Glovewort (3), head through the doorway to the north to interact with the Nokron, Eternal City Site of Grace and you will now emerge into the heart of the city.\n\nThe Mimic Tear\nRight ahead, lying on the steps of a gazebo is a corpse that has the Ghost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing (1) on them. There are corpses strewn around that have a Smithing Stone (4), Smithing Stone (5), and Somber Smithing Stone (4), as well as a Ghost Glovewort (3) and Ghost Glovewort (4) on the ground that you can collect. If you head east, next to the stairs going down, you'll find a small graveyard where you can collect the Greatshield Soldier Ashes, and two Ghost Glovewort (3). In the building opposite of the graveyard, you'll find a corpse inside with a Larval Tear guarded by two Fallen Hawks Soldiers.\nWhen you're done collecting items in this area, descend the stairs going eastward and turn right at the corner (see image below).\n\nYou'll be able to see a fog door in the distance. Head towards it, looting the corpses on the way for another Larval Tear, a Ghost Glovewort (3), and a Golden Rune (7). At the bottom of the crumbling steps turn around for a Rune Arc on a dead body.  When you're ready to face the boss, transverse through the mist.\nYou'll find yourself in a large temple ruin with no boss to be seen. Approach the center of the arena and the slime puddle will reveal itself to be the Mimic Tear, transforming into your character. Defeat it for the Silver Tear Mask, two Larval Tears, and to be able to progress further into Nokron, Eternal City.\nNight's Sacred Ground\nUpon exiting the arena, cross the bridge and as you cross it, you'll find a Teardrop Scarab that drops a Smithing Stone (5) and a Ghost Glovewort (3). While crossing the bridge, look to your left at the buildings  -- you'll see a small ledge not too far from one of the angled roofs. This ledge will be the next Site of Grace, Ancestral Woods.  Note that you cannot get to it yet, that is coming up soon however.\n\nContinue crossing the bridge, and as soon as it's safe to (meaning not jumping over the edge and dying), turn left and get off the bridge.  You will know the spot when you see the side has crumbled and a path is available.\nAs you exit the bridge, you'll see the first of the 6 Flame Pillars/Altars to activate.\nTo activate it, walk up to the pillar/altar and then press the Interact button.\n\nWalk westwards along a brick path, and follow it leftwards until you reach the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace.\nFacing southwest, jump down to the roof of the building. (Don't worry about collecting items in the northeast yet, you will be back here later.) Jump down to the next building's ledge and turn right, then jump down to the corpse hanging over the banister with a Rejuvenating Boluses on it.\n\nYou've reached Night's Sacred Ground, but the safe way down might not be too obvious yet. Continue following the edge of this building and you'll find another Rune Arc on a corpse at the top of the large stairs to your right. Facing the corpse that had the Rune Arc, turn left, you can run and jump onto the building to the west/ northwest. From here, turn right (face north) and walk along the ledge, turning a corner to find a Celestial Dew. Make your way back to where you landed on this building, following the ledge around to your right. You can jump onto another building to collect a Silver Tear Husk. Make your way back to the building with the stairs that had the Rune Arc. Jump across to it (you should have the side of the stairs in your face now) with another Silver Tear Husk at your feet.\n\nTurn right and now and jump down to the next building with a dome-shaped roof, where there are Silver Tears hanging out. These Silver Tears will be tougher to deal with as they can transform into silver-skinned humanoids. Defeat them, collect the Rune(7) and Silver Tear Husk (x3) then head east, following the building's edge, wrap around the corner then another corner to find Nascent Butterfly. Head back to the broken wall ruins that you can drop down to and move along to reach the open windows on the other side.\n\nYou should now find yourself in the main temple of Night's Sacred Ground. On the corpse slumped in front of the altar, you'll find the Black Whetblade.\n\nHead through the hallway to the east, ahead you'll find an imp statue next to a door that has to be unlocked with a Stonesword Key, inside of it you'll find a Nox Swordstress, a chest containing the Mimic Tear Ashes, and a Smithing Stone (3) on the right-side of the door when you enter. Coming out, turn back around facing the room with the Black Whetblade. The left side of the wall has three open windows. You want to jump out the first window on your left (if coming from the Imp Statue that takes the Stonesword Key). Jumping out of the other two windows will cause you to fall to your death, so if you're unsure, simply jump onto the ledge first, then check that it is safe to jump.\n\nKill the enemy from where you landed outside the window then run and jump over the gap.\n\nMaking your way towards the buttress, go by another window on your right, staying on the roof to find Nascent Butterfly. Now backtrack to the open window you passed, jump in and you can claim the Nox Flowing Hammer from a corpse.  While up here you can use ranged attacks to take out the enemies below if you want to.\n\nDrop down into the room, keeping the wall to your right/ head north when you land. You'll come across a ladder that will take you back up to the room with the Black Whetblade.  Climb the ladder if you would rather deal with the two Night Maidens from above vs slugging it out with them.\n\n Take out the two Night Maidens bowing to a large silver ball. The ball is a Silver Sphere, and it drops a Larval Tear upon defeat. You'll be finding a few more of these Silver Sphere in Nokstella, Eternal City if you're looking for more of these drops. Head out the entrance of the temple, turn right, descend the stairs to find the Nights Sacred Ground Site of Grace to your left.\n\nAfter you've rested, continue northeast up the road, defeating enemies and pillaging corpses for loot, including a Celestial Dew and Golden Rune (7), along the way. It should be noted that the Silver Tear right at the base of the stairs transforms into a Troll.  If you kill a Silver Tear before it has time to transform it will not.\n\nAt the top of the stairs and underneath the massive skeleton on its throne, you'll find a chest containing the Hidden Treasure of Nokron, the Fingerslayer Blade.  If you are following Ranni the Witch questline, this is what you were looking for.\n There is also a Great Ghost Glovewort. The waygate next to this giant statue will take you back up to the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace.\n\n(Alternate route: From the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace, mount Torrent and hop onto the nearby rock. With this elevation, a carefully-placed double jump should be able to get you on the roof of the immediate building, as opposed to the intended path. From there, you can hop from roof to roof of the buildings. Once you enter the bounds of Night's Sacred Grounds, you can drop from roof to roof of the building, then land carefully on the edge of the wall, before dropping to your destination and collect the Fingerslayer Blade. Note that this route will skip all of the other loot detailed above.)\nThe Rest of Nokron\nFeel free to explore this hilly part of Nokron and its ruins to collect valuable items. You can follow the brick road to the cliff, turn left and follow the cliff edge until you can find a spot where you can safely jump onto the lower level of the bridge that you were crossing to get here. Follow the path northeast and carefully descend into a room with Clarifying Horn Charm (+1), Celestial Dew, and Smithing Stone (2). If you go outside and head right, there is a Smithing Stone (5) between pillars.\nWhile you explore, you may have noticed that there is another Hallowhorn Grounds area here with unlit obelisks, like that in Siofra River. You'll find the Mottled Necklace (+1) by climbing up the ruined supports here. The altars you need to activate can be found in the following places:\n\nFirst Pillar is by the cliff's edge, next to the broken bridge you took to get here. [Elden Ring Map Link]\nSecond Pillar is by the side of the brick road, just further up from the first pillar. [Elden Ring Map Link]\n\nThird Pillar is up on the ledge next to the brick road with an Ancestral Follower singing by it. [Elden Ring Map Link]. You can find a Ghost Glovewort (4) slightly southeast of this pillar.\n\nFouth Pillar is found by a large rock, northwest from the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace. Mind the Lesser Red Wolf of Radagon patrolling the area, though you can light the flame without first defeating him. [Elden Ring Map Link]. Further southwest, by the cliffs, you'll be able to also find a Somber Smithing Stone (5).\n\nFifth Pillar is by the cliff's edge, next to submerged ruins and guarded by some Giant Rats and chanting Ancestral Followers. [Elden Ring Map Link]. The Teardrop Scarab that drops the Ash of War: Enchanted Shot can also be found nearby.\n\nSixth Pillar is behind a deer carcass in a ruin right beside the Hallowhorn Grounds. [Elden Ring Map Link]\n\nWhen you get to the Fifth Pillar, it may be worth taking a detour to the submerged ruins down in the water. You'll find a Ghost Glovewort (5), and the Ancestral Infant's Head in a chest at the far end of the ruins. Once all six altars are lit, you'll see the message: "Powers gathers somewhere in horned remains".\n\nHead back to Hallowhorn Grounds to challenge the Regal Ancestor Spirit and obtain the Remembrance of the Regal Ancestor.\n\nAlso, from the stairs leading up to the Hallowhorn Grounds, you can circle around the left side, going as far uphill as you can, until you can climb onto the broken arches of its roof. There is a corpse up there where you can collect a Mottled Necklace (+1).\nSiofra Aqueduct\nNow, head over to the cliff behind the Hallowhorn Grounds where there's a bunch of spirit jellyfish. If you look down, there's a small ledge you can jump to. To your right is a corpse with a Stonesword Key on it, and to your left is a cavern with the Aqueduct-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace.\n\nFollow the path further down, and look to your right. You'll see a Crucible Knight patrolling a walkway, with some loot at the far end of the walkway.\n\nContinue down the path, and jump down onto a structure that leads you into a building connected to the walkway.\n\nThis long structure is the Siofra Aqueduct. From this cliff you can snipe at the Crucible Knight below, or drop down from the support structure into the circular platform to fight it up-front. Defeating that Crucible Knight gets you the Crucible Hornshield, and then you can go to the end of the walkway it was patrolling to find the Missionary's Cookbook (5). Head the other way and enter the large rooms, taking out any Fallen Hawks on the way. There is a second Crucible Knight looking out into the distance who won't attack unless you get too close to it -- however killing it will drop a Somber Stone [6].\n\nThere are some branching platforms on the outer walls of the aqueduct with valuable items such as the Order Healing spell, a Golden Centipede, and a Rune Arc. There is also a remains on the edge of a walkway with a Golden Rune [13] and another nearby with a Golden Rune [7].\n\nIf instead you went left, you'll find an NPC - D, Beholder of Death(D, Hunter of the Dead's twin brother) sitting on the outer section of the aqueduct who gives you the Inner Order Gesture. You can give him the Twinned Armor Set you should have picked up from D(HOD).'s corpse (found in a new room that opens near the blacksmith, Fia is beside the body).\n\nThis will activate a nearby summon sign, progress Fia's ending quest and you'll still have an opportunity to get D.'s armor back, as well as a bonus weapon.\nNavigate your way to the lowest level of the Siofra Aqueduct, and exit the structure to emerge into a cavern at the base of a large waterfall.\n\nRight near the end of this passageway is a summon sign for D, Beholder of Death for the upcoming fight.\n\nAs you approach it, a Valiant Gargoyle will jump down from the ceiling, and after taking him to about half health, a Valiant Gargoyle (Twinblade) jumps down to join him in the fight. Defeat them both and you'll be rewarded with the Gargoyle's Greatsword and Gargoyle's Twinblade. The Great Waterfall Basin Site of Grace will be accessible after this boss fight. If you head north-west from here, you'll find a coffin that will take you to Deeproot Depths.\n\nElden Ring Nokron, Eternal City Maps and Notes\n[other maps go here]\n\nAll Elden Ring Locations\n\nAbandoned Cave  ♦  Academy Crystal Cave  ♦  Academy Gate Town  ♦  Aeonia Swamp  ♦  Ailing Village  ♦  Ainsel River  ♦  Ainsel River Main  ♦  Ainsel River Well  ♦  Albinauric Rise  ♦  Altus Plateau  ♦  Altus Tunnel  ♦  Apostate Derelict  ♦  Artist's Shack  ♦  Auriza Hero's Grave  ♦  Auriza Side Tomb  ♦  Bellum Church  ♦  Bellum Highway  ♦  Bestial Sanctum  ♦  Black Knife Catacombs  ♦  Boilprawn Shack  ♦  Bridge of Sacrifice  ♦  Caelem Ruins  ♦  Caelid  ♦  Caelid Catacombs  ♦  Caelid Colosseum  ♦  Caelid Waypoint Ruins  ♦  Callu Baptismal Church  ♦  Capital Outskirts  ♦  Caria Manor  ♦  Carian Study Hall  ♦  Carriage  ♦  Castle Morne  ♦  Castle Sol  ♦  Cathedral of Manus Celes  ♦  Cathedral of the Forsaken  ♦  Cave of the Forlorn  ♦  Chapel of Anticipation  ♦  Chelona's Rise  ♦  Church of Dragon Communion  ♦  Church of Elleh  ♦  Church of Inhibition  ♦  Church of Irith  ♦  Church of Pilgrimage  ♦  Church of Repose  ♦  Church of the Plague  ♦  Church of Vows  ♦  Cliffbottom Catacombs  ♦  Colosseums  ♦  Consecrated Snowfield Catacombs  ♦  Converted Fringe Tower  ♦  Converted Tower  ♦  Corpse-Stench Shack  ♦  Craftsman's Shack  ♦  Cuckoo's Evergaol  ♦  Deathtouched Catacombs  ♦  Deep Ainsel Well  ♦  Deep Siofra Well  ♦  Deeprooth Depths  ♦  Demi-Human Forest Ruins  ♦  Divine Tower of Caelid  ♦  Divine Tower of East Altus  ♦  Divine Tower of Limgrave  ♦  Divine Tower of Liurnia  ♦  Divine Tower of West Altus  ♦  Dragon-Burnt Ruins  ♦  Dragonbarrow  ♦  Dragonbarrow Cave  ♦  East Windmill Pasture  ♦  Effigies of the Martyr  ♦  Elden Throne  ♦  Eternal City  ♦  First Church of Marika  ♦  Flame Peak  ♦  Forbidden Lands  ♦  Forest Lookout Tower  ♦  Forge of the Giants  ♦  Forlorn Hound Evergaol  ♦  Forsaken Ruins  ♦  Fort Faroth  ♦  Fort Gael  ♦  Fort Haight  ♦  Fort Laiedd  ♦  Fourth Church of Marika  ♦  Frenzied Flame Proscription  ♦  Frenzied Flame Village  ♦  Frenzy-Flaming Tower  ♦  Fringefolk Hero's Grave  ♦  Gael Tunnel  ♦  Gaol Cave  ♦  Gatefront Ruins  ♦  Gelmir Hero's Grave  ♦  Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave  ♦  Golden Lineage Evergaol  ♦  Gowry's Shack  ♦  Grand Cloister  ♦  Grand Lift of Dectus  ♦  Grand Lift of Rold  ♦  Groveside Cave  ♦  Guardians' Garrison  ♦  Hallowhorn Grounds  ♦  Heretical Rise  ♦  Hermit's Shack  ♦  Hermit Merchant's Shack  ♦  Hermit Village  ♦  Hidden Path to the Haligtree  ♦  Highroad Cave  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Liurnia)  ♦  Impaler's Catacombs  ♦  Isolated Divine Tower  ♦  Isolated Merchant's Shack (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Jarburg  ♦  Kingsrealm Ruins  ♦  Lake of Rot  ♦  Lakeside Crystal Cave  ♦  Laskyar Ruins  ♦  Lenne's Rise  ♦  Leyndell Catacombs  ♦  Leyndell Colosseum  ♦  Leyndell Royal Capital  ♦  Limgrave  ♦  Limgrave Colosseum  ♦  Limgrave Tunnels  ♦  Lord Contender's Evergaol  ♦  Lunar Estate Ruins  ♦  Lux Ruins  ♦  Malefactor's Evergaol  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Caelid)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Consecrated Snowfield)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Northeast)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Southwest)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mistwood)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mountaintops East)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mt.

QUESTION
Why is the Nokron, Eternal City referred to as an ancient city punished for high treason against the Greater Will?

ANSWER
The Nokron, Eternal City is referred to as an ancient city punished for high treason against the Greater Will due to its history of rebelling against a higher power.
