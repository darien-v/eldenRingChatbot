The Lusat's Glintstone Staff scales primarily with Strength and Intelligence and is a good Weapon for conjuring high sorcery damage. \n\nStaff of the primeval glintstone sorcerer Lusat. Only those whohave glimpsed what lies beyond the wisdom of stone may wield it.\nEnhances power of all sorceries, but consumes additional FP.\n\nWhere to Find Lusat's Glintstone Staff in Elden Ring\nThe Lusat's Glintstone Staff weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nSellia, Town of Sorcery: Found in a chest north of the Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest boss duo's chamber after defeating them.

If the armament in the other hand has a skill, that skill will be used instead.\nThis weapon can be used without meeting the 10 STR requirement (which does not impact the Sorcery Scaling modifier), however, that does double the amount of stamina used for casting spells and lowers the generation of frostbite on Freezing Mist. For maximum dps, obtaining 10 STR is recommended.\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War nor enchanted with Magic.\nLusat's Glintstone Staff can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones.\nIncreases FP costs by 50%. High sorcery scaling, but no bonus to sorcery damage outside of that. At 80 and 99 INT, the extra scaling grants ~11% more damage over the Carian Regal Scepter.\nSorcery Scaling of 413 with 80 INT.\nWhile Lusat's Staff does not provide any specific advantages for his personal school of spells (Glintstone Stars, Star Shower, and Stars of Ruin), all of those spells are multi-projectile spells, which, due to the way defenses and absorptions work, will perform better when you maximize damage of individual casts (as opposed to increasing the quantity of spells cast - see Azur's Glintstone Staff).  \n\nWearing Lusat's Glintstone Crown will further enhance this small niche of Glintstone sorceries.\n\nSell Value:   500\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
