These large stone gargoyles are held together with black corpse wax, indicating their allegiance to Maliketh. This is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, doing so yields useful Items and Runes.\nValiant Gargoyle is another variant of this boss.\n\n Valiant Gargoyles, mended with blackened corpse wax. Such is the mark of those who serve Maliketh, the Black Blade.\n\nElden Ring Black Blade Kindred Locations\n\nBestial Sanctum [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nForbidden Lands [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nBlack Blade Kindred Combat Information\n\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being stance broken\nWeak spot: head\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 0\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Black Blade Kindred Boss Guide\n\nBlack Blade Kindred Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Black Blade Kindred:\n\nUse the Stone of Gurranq spell, awarded by giving Gurranq his 6th Deathroot. This spell comes out decently fast, deals good amounts of damage, and can be used in succession. It also usually aims for the Kindred's head and can even break its poise while doing so. Lightning Spear and Frenzied Burst can work well as ranged offensive spells.For Intelligence players, Glintstone Cometshard or even just Great Glintstone Shard can work wonders. If you have enough set-up, casting Comet Azur can melt the Kindred although the boss can easily avoid it. \nSuggested weapons: 2 Great Omenkiller Cleavers with Strength/Occult affinity and infused with Cragblade Ash of War. Any weapon infused with Glintblade Phalanx will also work great because it can stance break the gargoyle in 3 hits of the skill.\nBring some Boiled Crabs or Prawns, as they provide great boosts to one's physical defense, which may be needed as the boss hits extremely hard. \nSummon Latenna the Albinauric, as she can provide a constant source of damage with her arrows, as long as the player can keep the Kindred's attention. Other multi-summon Ashes like Mausoleum Soldiers or Greatshield Soldiers can work well.\nSummon Millicent. She is decently tanky and brings great offense against a fast and large foe like the Kindred. She can also serve as a distraction.\nDue to its high damage per hit, Opaline Bubbletear mixed in Flask of Wondrous Physick is recommended. It allows you to almost nullify one, and only one of its hits.\n\nMelee Users\nMagic and Ranged Users\nAt the Bestial Sanctum, you can stand on the ledge to his right and most of his attacks will not reach you. He will aggressively attack the corner, but the difference in elevation will keep the attacks from connecting. However, he will eventually become unstuck, usually when a leaping attack carries him up the stairs or a jump back lands him on the opposite ledge. The railing in the corner also is an obstacle to many ranged attacks. Standing on top of the railing or on horseback can help with this, but puts you more at risk of him becoming unstuck or you falling off.\nIt can be cheesed relatively easily at Bestial Sanctum, but its high HP and the range of the roar attack can make it very tedious. Its initial position makes it very easy to get in a single attack, and it will de-aggro easily and return to that position given enough time. Using ranged attacks, you can exploit this to safely attack once or twice, run to safety, and wait for it to return to the base of the steps and turn around.It cannot enter the Bestial Sanctum, but most of his attacks can still hit you through the walls. The roar attack can reach all the way to the Bestial Clergyman (who mercifully will ignore being hit by it), so trying to attack from inside the building is not an effective approach. But if you run all the way to the back of the Sanctum, behind the Clergyman, he will eventually de-aggro and return to his original position.Another reliable approach for this method is the right ledge. You can easily land a magic attack from there (dragon breath spells can pass through the railing as well), and have enough time to summon the horse and run away. Instead of running into the sanctum, where you might get hit with a roar before you can get to safety, run around the side of the building. There are a number of obstacles in that direction that slow him down and shield you from a roar. You can simply circle the building at your own pace, and from the other side, you can stay out of sight and see when he returns to the base of the stairs. It seems to take a shorter amount of time for him to reset, compared to hiding in the sanctum.\n\nBlack Blade Kindred (Bestial Sanctum) Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSword Attacks\nCleaves the sword in a forward motion attack. It may also launch a devastating combo of sword slashes.\nRoll to either side. Getting behind it also works as well.\n\nSword Thrust\nThe Kindred draws its sword back and thrusts forward. It may use this attack during any of its combos\nDodge to the sides or through it.\n\nHalberd Switch\nSheathes its sword and grabs the halberd from its back, performing a twisting attack.\nThe Kindred takes a few seconds before it actually swings the halberd but is somewhat hard for melee players to hit it as it is drawing it out, as it moves backwards as it does so. However, ranged weapons can more easily hit the Kindred as it does so and when it finally swings the halberd, it can easily be jumped over, given you a chance to do a jumping attack.\n\nAerial Halberd Sweep\nThe Kindred flies up into the air with its halberd at its right side (Left side from your perspective) then tries to crash back down on you while swinging the halberd after about a second's delay.\n Look closely at the Kindred when it does this attack. Here are 3 ways you can dodge it.\n\nAs the Kindred is diving towards you, dodge roll in any direction at the last second.\nWhen you see the Kindred fly up in the air, move backwards a little bit. (Sprinting and rolling isn't necessary) When the Kindred dives to you, jump OVER the halberd so you can punish this attack with a jumping attack of your own. The Kindred itself doesn't have a hitbox, only the halberd does, so you shouldn't take any damage even if you end up touching it.\nThis tactic is considerably riskier than the others, but is still viable. As soon as possible when the Kindred flies, sprint TOWARDS it and get as close under it as you can. If you are fast enough and get close enough to it, the Kindred will dive over you and swing its halberd in the opposite direction from where you are, giving you some time to do a couple of counter attacks. Avoid this strategy if you don't have sufficient stamina to sprint long enough and/or you don't feel confident you will make it on time.\n\nSpinning Slash\nUsing its halberd to charge up by initially bringing it to it's left (Or your right), the Kindred will spin it and around twice.\n Back away from this attack when you see the halberd on your right, as it has a very large hitbox. Don't be fooled if you are just out of range of the first spin, the second spin has slightly more reach. An alternative but riskier counter to this attack is to sprint towards the Kindred when you see its halberd on your right so you are practically touching its feet then crouch. If done correctly, the 2 slashes should go over you without hitting you at all. This strategy can be made even more consistent by crouch walking backwards and slightly to your right as the Kindred is swinging to make sure you are as close as possible in front of it and this attack ends with the halberd on your left. \n\nBeast's Roar\nRoars a sonic projectile in a straight line.\nDodge to either side. Unless you are very far away from the Kindred for an excessive amount of time, it will never do this attack.\n\nCharge Forth\nThe Kindred charges forward with its halberd blade in the ground at the front of it and finishes with an upward slash attack.\nDodge to either side or forwards when the halberd is close to you. \n\nCorpse Wax Cutter\nRaises its sword and then slams it down releasing a reddish wave of energy. It will rapidly drain health for a short period of time if the target was damaged by it.\nRoll to your left side when the Kindred's sword goes down. Dodging to the right is slighter harder to pull off, because the attack arcs slightly or is aimed slightly at the your right (needs testing).\n\nCorpse Wax Whirlwind\nAfter a delay, the Kindred swings its Halberd around twice, creating a reddish tornado that covers a wide area, then end with an overhead slash. The whirlwind will rapidly drain your health, akin to the Black Knife's effect.\nIt's best to just roll away from the tornado than to roll through the attacks, it will most likely one-shot you if you're not careful.\n\nBlack Blade Kindred (Forbidden Lands)\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\n Twinblade Slashes\n Performs rapid spinning slashes with its twinblade.\n Dodge left or right, depending on its position.\n\n Axe Switch\n The Kindred puts away its twinblade and roars, before switching to its axe and slamming down, causing a shockwave. This shockwave will also drain your health for a short amount of time.\n Be ready to dodge once it switches.\n\n War Cry + Overhead Slam\n The Kindred releases a roar before slamming its axe downwards, also causing an exploding shockwave that drains your health.\n Roll away from this attack.\n\n Twinblade Switch\n It will sheathe its axe and switch to its twinblade, performing a spinning attack.\n Be prepared and dodge accordingly.\n\nCorpse Wax Whirlwind\nIt will begin rapidly spinning its twinblade, before releasing the whirlwind in a large circular area around it.If the target is too far away, it will jump up and land close to them.\nIt's best to just roll away from the tornado than to roll through the attacks, it will most likely one-shot you if you're not careful.\n\nBlack Blade Kindred Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nSame moveset as the Valiant Gargoyles, but with added health drain effect on its special moves, which fits with their lore of being Maliketh’s servants.\nOne guards Gurranq in front of the Bestial Sanctum, while the other guards the Grand Lift of Rold, which leads to the flame which can burn the Erdtree, and thus unbind Destined Death.\n\n Black Blade Kindred  Bestial Sanctum  \n\nDrops\n88,000Gargoyle's BlackbladeGargoyle's Black Halberd\n\nHP\n12,297\n\nElden Ring Black Blade Kindred Boss (Bestial Sanctum)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nThis gargoyle wields Gargoyle's Blackblade and Gargoyle's Black Halberd\nClosest Site of Grace: Bestial Sanctum\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nBlack Blade Kindred Location\nThis Black Blade Kindred stands just outside the entrance to the Bestial Sanctum.  [Map Link]\nBlack Blade Kindred Combat information\n\nHealth: 12,297 HP\nDefense: 121\nDamage: Standard (Halberd), Standard, Slash, Holy (Greatsword)\nDrops 88,000, Gargoyle's Blackblade. Gargoyle's Black Halberd\n\nAdditional Fight Strategy\n\nYou can reach this boss very early on in the game, but it's a good idea to wait until you're stronger to try to defeat it.\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n12,297\n12,309\n13,539\n14,155\n14,770\n16,001\n16,617\n17,232\n\nDefense\n121\n120\n123\n126\n132\n138\n144\n156\n\nRunes\n88,000\n176,000\n193,600\n198,000\n211,200\n215,600\n220,000\n224,400\n\n Black Blade Kindred  Forbidden Lands  \n\nDrops\n60,000Gargoyle's Black AxeGargoyle's Black Blades\n\nHP\n8,452\n\nElden Ring Black Blade Kindred Boss (Forbidden Lands)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nThis gargoyle wields Gargoyle's Black Blades and Gargoyle's Black Axe\nClosest Site of Grace: Grand Life of Rold\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: Millicent. Advance in her questline until you defeat Godskin Apostle in Windmill Village, and her summon sign will be available north of the Stake of Marika in the Forbidden Lands.\n\nBlack Blade Kindred Location\nThis Black Blade Kindred guards the entrance to the Grand Lift of Rold, along the path from the Forbidden Lands Site of Grace.
