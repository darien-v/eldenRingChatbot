CONTEXT
\nRunes in Elden Ring, analogous to the Souls of previous FromSoftware titles, act as the player's EXP and currency for Merchants. You will drop any runes in your possession at the site of your death. If you die again before reclaiming those runes, they will be lost forever. The compass at the top of the screen indicates the direction of the lost runes.\n\nSee Leveling for details on how to level up, a breakdown of runes necessary per level, and more.\nSee Stats for a rundown of attribute points, attack power, damage negation, and all other player stats.\nSee Rebirth for details on how to reallocate (respec) assigned attribute points.\n\nHow to Obtain Runes in Elden Ring\nEnemies are the main source of runes. Defeating the inhabitants of the Lands Between will award you both runes and Items.\nOccasionally enemies have golden glowing eyes, indicating that they will drop five times their usual amount of runes.\nBosses are a substantial source of runes. Conquering the strongest of foes merits a bounty of runes.\nRemembrances drop from certain bosses upon defeat which can be consumed for runes or exchanged for powerful items.\nDuring Multiplayer Co-op, the Host receives 75% of the boss's rune reward and Cooperators receive 25%\nGolden Rune Consumables are a reliable source of runes. Like all items, they are not lost on death so you can store them up and use them when you need a few more runes. \nPlayer-vs-Player rewards runes after either a successful invasion or defense against fellow Tarnished.\n\nHow to Use Runes in Elden Ring\nLeveling: Available at any site of grace after meeting Melina, players can spend runes to increase their stats.\nPlayers have an opportunity to reallocate attribute points later through Rebirth.\nMerchants: Runes can buy a variety of Items, Weapons, and other goods from the more sociable denizens of the Lands Between.\nOccasionally, merchants offer certain items with an unlimited stock, accommodating even the greatest of spending sprees.\n\nRune-Granting Consumables in Elden Ring\nThe following Consumables grant a fixed number of Runes upon use:\n\nLands Between Rune -   3000\nGolden Rune [1] -   200\nGolden Rune [2] -   400\nGolden Rune [3] -  800\nGolden Rune [4] -   1.200\nGolden Rune [5] -   1.600\nGolden Rune [6] -  2.000\nGolden Rune [7] -   2.500\nGolden Rune [8] -  3.000\nGolden Rune [9] -  3.800\nGolden Rune [10] -   5.000\nGolden Rune [11] -  6.250\nGolden Rune [12] -  7.500\nGolden Rune [13] -  10.000\nNumen's Rune -  12.500\nHero's Rune [1] -  15.000\nHero's Rune [2] -   20.000\nHero's Rune [3] -   25.000\nHero's Rune [4] -   30.000\nHero's Rune [5] -   35.000\nLord's Rune -   50.000\nRemembrances - Can be consumed for Runes or exchanged to unlock their powers\n\nBoosting Rune Acquisition in Elden Ring\nEquipment and Consumables:\n\nGold-Pickled Fowl Foot - Increases rune acquisition by 30% for 3 minutes\nGold Scarab - Increases rune acquisition by 20% while equipped\n\nCelebrant Weapons: Weapons which grant runes on-hit (unaffected by acquisition boosts):\n\nCelebrant's Skull -  20\nCelebrant's Cleaver -   10\nCelebrant's Sickle -  10\nCelebrant's Rib-Rake -   10\n\nMultiplayer: When a player you share a Group Password with accomplishes a major feat, you receive a 5% increase to rune acquisition for five minutes. Below are the possible accompanying messages: \n\n"Someone in the [1-5] group has defeated a shardbearer" \n"Someone in the [1-5] group has become a Lord" \n"Someone in the [1-5] group has become the Elden Lord"\n\nOverkill exists as it did in previous titles. If the first strike to an enemy deals over 150% of its max HP, it gives 20% more runes.\nGolden Leaves will occasionally shower from the Erdtree, increasing rune acquisition by 5% as long as the leaves are falling.\nPreventing Rune Loss: While not "boosting" rune acquisition, you can save your runes using the following.\n\nSacrificial Twig - Instead of losing your runes when you die, you will lose the Sacrificial Twig\nTwiggy Cracked Tear - Briefly stops rune loss on death (takes precedence over Sacrificial Twig when active)\n\nFarming Spots\n How to efficiently farm runes is an ever-evolving topic in Elden Ring that highly depends on the player's preferred method of farming, access to areas of the game world, and current player strength. Contributions are not only welcomed, but encouraged. Is it recommended that players who want to farm runes obtain the Golden Scarab talisman as early as possible, as it increases runes reward by 20%. In order to further increase rune rewards, it is possible in the late game to efficiently farm for Gold-Pickled Fowl Foot, to increase rune rewards by a further 30%, for a total increase of 56%.\n\n Early Game (1 - 35):\n\nIn Gatefront Ruins: Farm the enemies in the ruins. Use Spirit Ashes to clear out the encampment more quickly.  1,224 per run if the Godrick Knight is killed. [Map Link]\nIn Liurnia: Look for a nearby battle between spectral soldiers and giants and collect the runes once the battle has ended.  1,000 per run\nBy Limgrave Tower Bridge Site of Grace: After defeating Margit The Fell Omen, farm the three Golems along the bridge.  3,117 per run. [Map Link]\nImpassable Greatbridge Site of Grace: If you run past enemies on Torrent, you can get to this midgame location very early. Two groups of enemies are fighting one another next to this Site of Grace, and if you jump onto the cliff to the west, stand back, and let them kill each other. Each run takes a few minutes but is both low-risk and low-effort. About  4,000 per run. [Map Link]\n\nMid Game (35 - 75):\n\nBy Lenne's Rise: Go down the slope. A ball will spawn and try to smash you, but you can turn right, dodge the ball, and let it fall down the cliff. Continue down the path a short way for another identical ball, just under an overhanging tree. One run takes around 30 seconds and doesn't require any fighting. Make sure the ball goes off the side of the cliff and is close enough that you get the runes.  3,904 per run. [Map Link]\n\nLate Game (75+):\n\nBy Dragonbarrow Fork Site of Grace: Go up the slope and fight 16 poisoned Guardians. These have 983 HP so this farming spot requires a high damage output.  18,122 per run. [Map Link]\nBy Lower Capital Church Site of Grace: Kill the Omenkiller right outside, then run straight down into the sewers, turn left and then right ignoring the Rats and Lessser Fingercreepers along the way, and kill the Broken Statue at the end. Takes about 30 seconds.  About  5,000 per run. [Map Link]\nBy Palace Approach Ledge-Road Site of Grace: Stand on the cliffside and shoot the large bird at the other end. The arrow should hit the bird when it shows its back to the player. It will run towards the player and fall off the cliff. A run takes 15 to 20 seconds once you find the perfect spot to stand. Once you've defeated Elden Beast, you can also use the the Sacred Relic Sword's Wave of Gold skill to kill all the nearby Albinaurics.  11,038 runes per run without killing Albinaurics. [Map Link]. This spot is accessible in the mid-game (after beating Godrick the Grafted) by doing White-Mask Varre's quest and obtaining the Pureblood Knight's Medal. Killing the Albinaurics using a single Wave of Gold rewards about  32,000 runes from the right spot. Note that it is very advantageous to quickly go into NG+ in order to farm runes, as the reward received from ennemies is doubled, making farming far more efficient.\nBy Prayer Room Site of Grace: Head out the northern opening to clear out several easy knights around the wall. Fast travel back to prayer room before reaching the room toward the bottom with the two larger and more difficult knights. Over  30,000 per run. [Map Link]\n\nRune "Bounties"\nThese locations or enemies yield an abundance of runes with minimal investment but can only be collected once.\n\n 75.000 by Fort Faroth: Kill Elder Dragon Greyoll just to the west. She can't defend herself if you attack her tail, and a Hemorrhage weapon can whittle down her substantial health bar even at a very low level. [Map Link]\n 45.000 by Lenne's Rise: Head north at night and let the Night's Cavalry notice you. Run up the slope, turn left, and keep going: the boss will die somehow on its way back to its original location. This has been patched in 1.08. It is still possible by getting the rider stuck between the bridge and the northwestern root, then shooting it from the southwestern end of the bridge.\n\nRunes Notes & Tips\n\nYou can hold at most  999,999,999 at one time.\nGolden Runes are included in Player Trade.\nUnless explicitly stated, rune acquisition boosts stack multiplicatively.\n\n
