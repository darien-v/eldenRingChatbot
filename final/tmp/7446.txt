Elden Ring Interactive Map Link \n\nElden Ring Flame of the Fell God Guide\n\nFire Giant Incantation\nStamina Cost: 42\nDeals fire damage\nCan knock back enemies upon exploding, useful against bosses like Malenia.\nHigh FP cost and only moderate damage make it not a spell to be thrown out casually. However, it can be a good setup tool when used skillfully\nFollowing the projectile while it tracks your target can make it difficult for other players to pressure you. If you're next to it when it begins to explode, this can give you time to cast another incantation, such as a heal or buff, while protected by the threat of the blast and lingering flames.\nThis spell is extremely effective against Erdtree Avatars, they're weak to fire damage and have low mobility, often standing in the lingering flames for the whole duration.\nThe very slow projectile speed can be a boon in certain cases as well, casting it when an enemy is unawares can allow you to cast another slow or a fully charged incantation, which will combo into the explosion of the flame.\nNote: Multiple buffs in Patch 1.07 - FP cost reduced from 42 to 34, stamina damage against guarding enemies is increased and the damage detection time of residual flames was shortened. (Patch Notes were corrected in Patch 1.07.1 as this spell could not be charged as it was stated in 1.07 official Patch Notes.)\n\nPyromancer Written Guide\n\nElden Ring Flame of the Fell God Notes and Tips\n\nUpdated to patch 1.07.
