These are optional bosses as players are not required to defeat them to advance in Elden Ring.\nSee also Magma Wyrm Makar and Great Wyrm Theodorix.\n\n Those who have performed the Dragon Communion will find their humanity slowly slipping away. Once they fully succumb to their fate, they are left no more than wyrms that crawl the earth.\n\nElden Ring Magma Wyrm Locations\n\nGael Tunnel [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nFort Laiedd [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nVolcano Manor [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nMagma Wyrm Combat information\n\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\n Dragon type\nWeak spot: Head\nDamage: Slash, Strike, Fire\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 100\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Magma Wyrm Boss Guide\n\nMagma Wyrm Boss Video Guide\n\nMagma Wyrm Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Magma Wyrm:\n\nUse Redmane Knight Ogha Ashes for his durability, fire resistance, and ranged attacks which can hit the Magma Wyrm's head for extra damage\nIf you don't have Ogha yet, Crystalian Ashes, Banished Knight Engvall Ashes, or Banished Knight Oleg Ashes are all effective for drawing (and surviving) aggresion\nOn the other hand, Ancestral Follower Ashes and Latenna the Albinauric are useful for hitting its head for extra damage\nUse the Rock Sling spell to take advantage of its weakness to physical damage\nUse Flamedrake Talisman to reduce fire damage\n\nMelee Users\nHeads I Win: Magma Wyrm takes more damage if you attack its head, so if you learn when it's vulnerable you can deal a lot of damage very quickly. Stay in front of it just far enough away to easily dodge its sword attacks but close enough to move in when it starts using Lava Belch. Avoid its sides if at all possible: it's hard to read its windups from there so its attacks can take you by surprise.\nTails You Lose: On the other hand, very few of its attacks can reliably or quickly hit directly behind it. If you focus on attacking its tail, you won't do as much damage but you won't have to work as hard to stay alive. If it starts to turn around, back up and move back in when you have a safe opportunity to run through its legs. Just be careful not to get boxed in by the lava it leaves lying on the ground.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nHeads Up: Magic and ranged users have the advantage of being able to target its head at any time for extra damage. You can use quick-casting spells for added accuracy, or focus more on physical spells to take advantage of its relative lack of physical defense. Whatever you do, though, avoid fire damage because of its massive fire resistance.\nOrbital Dynamics: Magma Wyrm doesn't rotate very quickly, so try to continue moving around it so it spends as much time as possible turning rather than attacking. This is particularly useful when you're using spirit summons: whenever it's focused on them, use that opportunity to stand on its opposite side to it has to rotate as much as possible once you draw its ire.\n\nMagma Wyrm Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nPhase 1\n\nSwing\nSwings its scalesword in various directions\nRoll into the swing or jump over it since it usually stays close to the ground\n\nHook\nAfter a downsward swing that extends its sword in front of it, pulls the sword back towards itself\nEither roll away from the wyrm through the sword, or keep to its right flank so the attack misses entirely\n\nScalesword Slam\nLifts its sword horizontally in both hands, then slams it down doing damage in a large area\nRoll or jump forward slightly after its left hand grabs the sword, then attack its head\n\nGliding Slam\nGrabs its sword in its mouth and jumps into the air, gliding forward before slamming the sword on the ground as it lands\nIf you're close enough, run underneath it and attack its tail. If you're further away, run even further back\n\nCharge\nRaises its head as lava pools at its mouth, then charges forward while drooling lava along its path that lingers on the ground for a short time\nThe windup can look a lot like Lava Belch, so check to make sure its head is pointed outwards and its front feet stay on the ground. Roll to either side, keep your distance, and wait for this attack to finish and the lava to disperse before you renew your assault\n\nLava Belch\nRaises its head as lava pools at its mouth, then sends a glob flying at you. The lava lingers on the ground for a a short time\nIf it's facing forward the windup can look a lot like a Charge, so check to make sure its head is pointed straight up and both its hands lift off the ground. If so, you can safely attack for several secondsIf it's facing sideways, hug its body, move underneath its head, and attack\n\nPhase 2\n\nRise Up\nOnce it reaches 60% HP or lower, rises up onto its hind legs and drools lava onto its sword, leaving a pool that lingers on the ground for a short time. This is only used once and signals the beginning of Phase 2\nAttack its tail\n\nSwing\nSwings its scalesword in various directions\nRoll into the swings\n\nStab\nCrouches down then stabs its scalesword forward, then roars harmlessly\nRoll to your right and attack its head\n\nScalesword Chop\nTurns its head counterclockwise, raises its sword above its head, then quickly chops it down onto the ground. This does not create a shockwave\nRoll forward through the chop and attack its tail\n\nScalesword Slam\nRaises its sword high above its head with two hands, waits a moment, then slams it into the ground creating a massive shockwave\nAttack as it raises the sword, then roll back just after it lifts its right foot so you're positioned to attack its head. Don't bother trying to get behind it, since the shockwave will hit you anyway\n\nRolling Swing\nRolls onto its tail and then towards you before swinging its scalesword at you counterclockwise and down\nRoll left as soon as you see it open its mouth\n\nLava Belch\nRaises its head as lava pools at its mouth, then sends a glob flying at you. The lava lingers on the ground for a a short time\nRun towards it and attack its legs\n\nLava Spray\nRaises its head as lava pools at its mouth, then sprays many globs in a clockwise arc in front of it. The lava lingers on the ground for a a short time\nAttack it during the windup, then run behind it to avoid being pushed into the lava pools\n\nMagma Drool\nRaises its head as magma pools at its mouth if it's not in the middle of a combo, then lets it flow down in front of it, leaving a pool that lingers on the ground for a short time\nRun through its legs and attack its tail where the magma can't reach you\n\nMagma Wyrm Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nMagma Wyrms are individuals who have heavily partaken of Dragon Communion and degenerated into mere imiations of dragons.This is a recurring theme of Souls games, like in Dark Souls, there was a Dragon Cult built on worshipping and imitating the power of the Everlasting Dragons, and it is not too dissimilar here\nMagma Wyrms have two additional sets of teeth that protrude from the roofs of their mouths, similar to the pterygoidal teeth of mosasaurs\nThe Magma Wyrms’ breath cannot knock players down.\n\nMagma Wyrm Phase 1 Combo Chart\n\nMagma Wyrm Phase 2 Combo Chart\n\n Magma Wyrm  Gael Tunnel  \n\n__image__\n\nDrops\n7,500Dragon HeartMoonveil\n\nHP\n7,141\n\nElden Ring Magma Wyrm Boss (Gael Tunnel)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Gael Tunnel Entrance\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nMagma Wyrm Location\nThe end boss of Gael Tunnel.

QUESTION
Why was the Magma Wyrm once human and transformed into a lesser dragon for the sin of Dragon Communion?

ANSWER
Magma Wyrms were once human but transformed into lesser dragons for partaking heavily in Dragon Communion.
