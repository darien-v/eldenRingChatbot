[Map Link]\nThe tower is not accesssible until your encounter with Rykard and he is defeated. Before his defeat, the doors to the tower will be tightly blocked. The Divine Tower of West Altus is found in Capital Outskirts between Altus Plateau and Leyndell, Royal Capital. It can only be reached by going through a series of illusory walls found in Sealed Tunnel. The path is linear, so there's no way to miss it, and illusory walls are generally at the end of each new area. Interact with the walls until they are revealed. You will be generally descending through the tunnels through these walls and there will be elevators to take you to the lower levels. At the end of this route, you have to defeat the Onyx Lord. In the next area you are able to see the sky again but the path is still linear. Here you'll find the next Site of Grace and the entrance to the Divine Tower of West Altus. Once you reach the tower, step to the center of the tower platform to ascend. Take the stairs all the way up wrapping around the exterior of the tower to eventually reach. Here, you can restore the power of the Great Rune.
