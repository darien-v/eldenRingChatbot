He is the boss form of Gurranq Beast Clergyman. This Elden Ring Beast Clergyman Guide features boss locations, tips, strategies and videos on how to defeat the Beast Clergyman easily, as well as boss stats and lore for the Beast Clergyman.\nThe Beast Clergyman is found in Crumbling Farum Azula and is greatly implied to be Gurranq, as he recognises you and changes his dialogue if you have given Gurranq all 9 Deathroot. Despite this, defeating this boss does not result in Gurranq's death (and has no effect on your progress with his quest) and vice-versa. A possible explanation for this is that Crumbling Farum Azula exists outside of time.\nThis is NOT an optional boss as players MUST defeat it to reach an endgame area in Elden Ring. Although the Beast Clergyman is quite large and may seem sluggish at first glance, he is far from it and you should be mindful of his high mobility and quick attacks. After taking him down to 50-55% HP, a cutscene plays and you'll be faced off against Maliketh, the Black Blade. There are several Items and strategies for the fight against Maliketh that do not apply to the Beast Clergyman's fight, so make sure to be prepared for him as well.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Legend bosses drop their own unique Remembrance capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, Ashes of War, and Talismans for the player.\n\n Thou, who approacheth Destined Death. I will not have it stolen from me again.\n\nElden Ring Beast Clergyman Boss\nBeast Clergyman is a Legend Boss found in Crumbling Faram Azula.\n\nThis boss is NOT optional.\nThis is a Legend type boss.\nClosest Site of Grace: Beside the Great Bridge\nMultiplayer is allowed for this fight.\nSpirit ashes can be summoned for this fight.\n\nElden Ring Beast Clergyman Location\nBeast Clergyman can be found at the end stage of Crumbling Farum Azula. [Map Link]\n\nBeast Clergyman Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG (10,620), NG+ (10,631), NG++ (??), NG+3 (??), NG+4 (??), NG+5 (??), NG+6 (??), NG+7 (??) \n\nPhase 2 triggers at 55% HP\n\nDefenses do not change between phases\nDeals Standard Damage, Pierce Damage (1st phase) and Magic Damage and Holy Damage (2nd phase).\nParriable: No (1st phase), Yes (2nd phase with Blasphemous Claw only - if done successfully, Maliketh will cover his eyes and perform a slow sword slash from above his head)  \nPoise can be broken, which allows for a critical attack. Poise: 80\n\n Once roughly half of Beast Clergyman's health has been depleted, a cutscene will play and the battle with Maliketh, the Black Blade will begin.\n\nAbsorptions/Defenses\n\nPhy (Standard): 35 / 120\nPhy (Strike): 35 / 120\nPhy (Slash): 35 / 120\nPhy (Pierce): 35 / 120\n\nMagic: 40 / 120\nFire: 40 / 120\nLightning: 40 / 120\nHoly: 80 / 120\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if an absorption is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 351\nScarlet Rot: 351\nHemorrhage: 574\nFrostbite: 574\n\nSleep: 2277\nMadness: Immune\nDeath Blight: Immune\nPoise: 80\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs. Poise regenerates after 6 seconds without any hits or upon a poise break.\n\nElden Ring Beast Clergyman Boss Guide\n\nBeast Clergyman Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nBeast Clergyman Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Beast Clergyman:\n\nUse the Mimic Ash Summons.

Tools are unique, reusable items which assist the player during various facets of gameplay ranging from basic communication to assisting in boss encounters.\n\nA slab of rock engraved with traces of the Rune of Death.  Can deflect the power of the Black Blade.  On the night of the dire plot, Ranni rewarded Praetor Rykard with these traces. Should the coming trespass one day transpire, they would serve as a last-resort foil, allowing Rykard to challenge Maliketh the Black Blade, the black beast of Destined Death.\n\nWhere to find Blasphemous Claw in Elden Ring\nThe Blasphemous Claw is dropped by Recusant Bernahl upon defeat at Crumbling Farum Azula. [Map Link]  Video Location\n\nBlasphemous Claw use in Elden Ring\n\nThe Blasphemous Claw can be used to deflect the power of the Black Blade, acting similarly to a Parry.\nCan parry specific melee attacks from Maliketh. His sword will briefly glow yellow before attacks that can be parried. \n\nHis sword also glows white before his projectile attacks, but these do not seem to be parriable.\n\nIf timed correctly against Maliketh's glowing attacks, stuns him temporarily, giving a massive window to attack.\nDoes not seem like the Blasphemous Claw can be used in PVP against the Black Blade incantation or Maliketh's Black Blade weapon. Has been tested a bit and did not seem to work against them, but more testing would be helpful.\n\nElden Ring Blasphemous Claw Notes & Tips\n\nThe Blasphemous Claw can be used indefinitely and costs no FP to use.\nYou can hold up to 1 Blasphemous Claw.\nYou can store up to 600 Blasphemous Claw.\nThis item cannot be sold.\n\nElden Ring Consumables\n\nAcademy Magic Pot  ♦  Acid Spraymist  ♦  Aeonian Butterfly  ♦  Albinauric Pot  ♦  Alluring Pot  ♦  Altus Bloom  ♦  Ancient Dragonbolt Pot  ♦  Baldachin's Blessing  ♦  Beastlure Pot  ♦  Bewitching Branch  ♦  Blood Grease  ♦  Bloodboil Aromatic  ♦  Boiled Crab  ♦  Boiled Prawn  ♦  Bone Dart  ♦  Budding Horn  ♦  Celestial Dew  ♦  Clarifying Boluses  ♦  Clarifying Cured Meat  ♦  Clarifying White Cured Meat  ♦  Crystal Dart  ♦  Cuckoo Glintstone  ♦  Cursed-Blood Pot  ♦  Dappled Cured Meat  ♦  Dappled White Cured Meat  ♦  Deathsbane Jerky  ♦  Deathsbane White Jerky  ♦  Dewkissed Herba  ♦  Dragon Heart  ♦  Dragonwound Grease  ♦  Drawstring Blood Grease  ♦  Drawstring Fire Grease  ♦  Drawstring Freezing Grease  ♦  Drawstring Holy Grease  ♦  Drawstring Lightning Grease  ♦  Drawstring Magic Grease  ♦  Drawstring Poison Grease  ♦  Drawstring Rot Grease  ♦  Elden Remembrance  ♦  Exalted Flesh  ♦  Explosive Stone  ♦  Explosive Stone Clump  ♦  Fan Daggers  ♦  Fetid Flesh  ♦  Fetid Pot  ♦  Fire Blossom  ♦  Fire Grease  ♦  Fire Pot  ♦  Fireproof Dried Liver  ♦  Flask of Cerulean Tears  ♦  Flask of Crimson Tears  ♦  Flask of Wondrous Physick  ♦  Freezing Grease  ♦  Freezing Pot  ♦  Frenzyflame Stone  ♦  Frozen Raisin  ♦  Furlcalling Finger Remedy  ♦  Ghost Glovewort (3)  ♦  Giantsflame Fire Pot  ♦  Glass Shard  ♦  Glintstone Scrap  ♦  Glowstone  ♦  Gold-Pickled Fowl Foot  ♦  Golden Centipede  ♦  Golden Rowa  ♦  Golden Rune (1)  ♦  Golden Rune (11)  ♦  Golden Rune (13)  ♦  Golden Rune (2)  ♦  Golden Rune (3)  ♦  Golden Rune (4)  ♦  Golden Rune (6)  ♦  Golden Rune (8)  ♦  Golden Runes  ♦  Grace Mimic  ♦  Grave Glovewort (1)  ♦  Grave Glovewort (2)  ♦  Grave Glovewort (4)  ♦  Grave Glovewort (5)  ♦  Gravity Stone Chunk  ♦  Gravity Stone Fan  ♦  Heavy Meteorite Fragment  ♦  Hero's Rune (1)  ♦  Hero's Rune (2)  ♦  Hero's Rune (5)  ♦  Holy Grease  ♦  Holy Water Grease  ♦  Holy Water Pot  ♦  Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear  ♦  Holyproof Dried Liver  ♦  Host's Trick-Mirror  ♦  Immunizing White Cured Meat  ♦  Invigorating Cured Meat  ♦  Invigorating White Cured Meat  ♦  Ironjar Aromatic  ♦  Kukri  ♦  Lands Between Rune  ♦  Large Glintstone Scrap  ♦  Lightning Grease  ♦  Lightning Pot  ♦  Lightning-Shrouding Cracked Tear  ♦  Lightningproof Dried Liver  ♦  Lord's Rune  ♦  Magic Grease  ♦  Magic Pot  ♦  Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear  ♦  Margit's Shackle  ♦  Melted Mushroom  ♦  Mimic's Veil  ♦  Miquella's Needle  ♦  Miranda's Prayer  ♦  Mohg's Shackle  ♦  Neutralizing Boluses  ♦  Numen's Rune  ♦  Oil Pot  ♦  Omen Bairn  ♦  Pauper's Rune  ♦  Pickled Turtle Neck  ♦  Poison Grease  ♦  Poison Pot  ♦  Poison Spraymist  ♦  Poisonbone Dart  ♦  Poisoned Stone  ♦  Poisoned Stone Clump  ♦  Prattling Pate Let's get to it  ♦  Prattling Pate My Beloved  ♦  Prattling Pate Please help  ♦  Prattling Pate Wonderful  ♦  Prattling Pate You're Beautiful  ♦  Preserving Boluses  ♦  Pureblood Knight's Medal  ♦  Radiant Baldachin's Blessing  ♦  Rainbow Stone  ♦  Rancor Pot  ♦  Raw Meat Dumpling  ♦  Regal Omen Bairn  ♦  Rejuvenating Boluses  ♦  Remebrance of the Black Blade  ♦  Remembrance of Hoarah Loux  ♦  Remembrance of the Black Blade  ♦  Remembrance of the Blasphemous  ♦  Remembrance of the Blood Lord  ♦  Remembrance of the Dragonlord  ♦  Remembrance of the Fire Giant  ♦  Remembrance of the Full Moon Queen  ♦  Remembrance of the Grafted  ♦  Remembrance of the Lichdragon  ♦  Remembrance of the Naturalborn  ♦  Remembrance of the Omen King  ♦  Remembrance of the Regal Ancestor  ♦  Remembrance of the Rot Goddess  ♦  Remembrance of the Starscourge  ♦  Rimed Crystal Bud  ♦  Roped Fetid Pot  ♦  Roped Fire Pot  ♦  Roped Fly Pot  ♦  Roped Freezing Pot  ♦  Roped Holy Water Pot  ♦  Roped Lightning Pot  ♦  Roped Magic Pot  ♦  Roped Oil Pot  ♦  Roped Poison Pot  ♦  Roped Volcano Pot  ♦  Rot Grease  ♦  Rot Pot  ♦  Rowa Raisin  ♦  Rune Arc  ♦  Sacramental Bud  ♦  Sacred Order Pot  ♦  Scriptstone  ♦  Shield Grease  ♦  Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot  ♦  Sleep Pot  ♦  Soap  ♦  Soft Cotton  ♦  Soporific Grease  ♦  Spark Aromatic  ♦  Spellproof Dried Liver  ♦  Stanching Boluses  ♦  Starlight Shards  ♦  Stimulating Boluses  ♦  Swarm Pot  ♦  Sweet Raisin  ♦  Thawfrost Boluses  ♦  Throwing Dagger  ♦  Uplifting Aromatic  ♦  Volcanic Stone  ♦  Volcano Pot  ♦  Warming Stone  ♦  Winged Crystal Tear  ♦  Wraith Calling Bell\n\nMelee Users\nStrategy Writeup for Melee Users\n(Work in progress) \nA safe way to get through the first phase is to hug one of the pillars. This will block most of the Beast Clergyman's attacks. He has one attack that is relatively safe to punish: You want to wait until he sticks his knife into the ground and then drags it across the screen from left to right. You can punish this with a jumping attack and then quickly return to circling the pillar. It can take a while to deal damage to him this way, but is a safe way to get through phase one. \nThis attack is easier to see coming if you circle anti-clockwise. Sometimes the lock-on will break, so try and reapply it when safe. Be careful not to stand too close to the pillar, as some of his attacks may still cause damage through it.\n\nMagic and Ranged Users\nThe Beast Clergyman uses many fast and rapid attacks at close range, maintain your distance and use spells that don't have long charge ups for this fight. Move around the pillars to use them as cover against the ranged rock throwing attacks when using flasks but try to watch out for the Beast Claw attack during this time as this attack will ignore the pillar.\n\nBeast Clergyman Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nRock  Spray\nThe boss drags its left hand on the ground, picking up rocks which it holds before throwing at you\nRoll to the side or move behind a pillar\n\nRock Throw\nThe boss drags its left hand on the ground and holds up a boulder before throwing it at you\nMove or Roll to the side, or move behind a pillar\n\nBeast Claw\nThe boss Raises their left arm in the air creating visible shock wave lines then slams their hand into the ground before swinging their arm at the player shortly after, sending shock waves towards the player. The shock waves are not stopped by the pillars in the room.\nRoll to the side\n\nSwipe attacks\nMultiple quick furious swipes with the sword in their right hand. 2 quick swipes, a forehand then a backhand, that can be followed up with more attacks\nRoll backwards and away from the boss to get out of range\n\n Fist smash \nThe boss holds its weapon in its mouth and slams the ground with its fists, causing random spots to crack, showing where boulders will shoot up and then hit the ground \nRun away at the start of the attack. Look at the ground to not run into the boulders\n\nBeast Clergyman Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Jonathan Keeble\nThis boss is somewhat similar to the Guardian Ape from Sekiro, in the sense that he wildly swings multiple times at the player with large claws (as beasts do). His use of incantations and special abilities make him far different in terms of strategy, however.\n\nDialogue\nIntroduction:\n(If not all Deathroot has been given to Gurranq): Thou, who approacheth Destined Death. I will not have it stolen from me again.\n(If all 9 Deathroot has been given to Gurranq): Tarnished. Why wouldst thou... Why... Tis no matter. I hereby vow, that Destined Death shall not be stolen again\nDuring Fight:\n(During transformation cutscene): O, Death. Become my blade, once more.\nAfter Fight:\n(If not all Deathroot has been given to Gurranq): Witless Tarnished... Why covet Destined Death? To kill what?\n(If all 9 Deathroot has been given to Gurranq): Forgive me, Marika...
