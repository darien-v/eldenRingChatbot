They are massive humanoid constructs created to protect and guard against intruders, wielding their massive weapons. Though large, their weakness is their low mobility and their ankles, which will topple them with ease.\n\nGolem Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to find Golems:\n\nA Halberd Golem is hiding around the ruins at the southwest of Stormhill, near the Evergaol. This one is inactive and will immediately wake up and begin attacking when provoked.  It does not respawn.\nThere is another Halberd Golem hiding in the northeast corner of Stormhill, right of the Colosseum, similar to the above one. It also does not respawn.\nAn Archer Golem can be found guarding the entrance to Ainsel River Well in the east side of Liurnia of the Lakes, to the east of the Church of Vows. It does not respawn.\nAn Archer Golem is guarding the entrance to Castle Morne. It does not respawn.\nTwo Golems and one Archer Golem can be found on the bridge to Divine Tower of Limgrave (They DO respawn, good for farming Golem's Halberd) [Map Link]\nA special Golem can be found at the east of Caelid at the bottom of a cliff by going to the east from the Minor Erdtree (Dragonbarrow). [Map Link] This one is unique as it wields a magic halberd and can summon orbs to shoot lasers at you. It is powerful and is not worth the risk to kill, as it does not drop unique items.\nTwo Archer Golems wielding magic bows guard the ravine towards the Caelid Colosseum and the Great-Jar. Their arrows explode upon hitting a surface.\nA Golem can be found in the fields west of the Shaded Castle near Maleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan. 2427   Runes (Confirmed can drop Golem's Halberd)\nTwo Golems are found guarding the Grand Lift of Dectus -- one wielding a Greatbow and one wielding a Halberd. \n\nUnlike other golems, they do not attack if player approaches them after using the lift.\n\nOne Golem can be found near the Divine Bridge Site of Grace in Leyndell, Royal Capital. [Map Link] It does not respawn. The Blessed Dew Talisman is in a chest near this golem. See more information below.\nTwo are south of the Freezing Lake grace in the Mountaintops of the Giants. They can be used to break the glowing statue containing Smithing Stones. [Map Link] \n\nProbably the best spot to farm for the Golem's Halberd\n\nDivine Bridge Golem\nThere's a particular non-respawning golem that is often confused with a boss due to its positioning. The "Divine Bridge Golem" can be found when proceeding across the Divine Bridge, the entrance to Leyndell, Royal Capital. The massive-sized Golem will be lying on the floor, only to slowly stand up and fight you, but it is not an enemy you must defeat and it is not a boss. [Map Link]\n\nMelee Users\nThe bridge golem is extremely easy for melee users.  With any two-handed melee weapon, immediately do a fully charged heavy attack on its legs twice.  This will cause it to fall over and allow a Critical Attack on its chest.  This can be immediately repeated before it finishes standing up for an easy win.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nSorcerers will want to have Rock Sling when engaging at a distance. Those good at reading attacks in close can hammer it with Glintstone Pebble, but one mistake can take a magic user out of the game with the low HP pool. Throw rocks at the ankles to knock the Golem down, then hit the chest with a couple of casts before retreating. The golem has an extremely long range reaching attack that can one-shot a magic user, so stay far back and advance to hit and run at the edge of Rock Sling's range.\n\nDivine Bridge Golem Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nGiant Axe Sweep\nSwings its halberd in a wide arc in front of it.\nRoll through or away from the attack.\n\nDouble Axe Sweep\nSwings its weapon across the ground twice while falling to its knees. Can be followed-up with the Flame Breath or Overhead Slam\nRoll through or away from the attack.\n\nFlame Breath\nThe golem's mouth flares up, before releasing a stream of fire in front of it.\nRoll to the left side of the flames to avoid getting hit. Use this opportunity to attack its legs.\n\nOverhead Slam\nLifts up the halberd with one hand before slamming it on the ground.\nRoll to the sides. Has a large windup, so be cautious.\n\nStomp\nLifts its legs and stomps the ground violently.\nJump or dodge through.\n\nHilt Slam\nLifts up its weapon and uses its hilt to slam the ground multiple times.

They are ideal for farming early game since defeating them will allow you to earn you Runes and additional EXP easily. This is especially beneficial for players who want to quickly level up early game. A good area to encounter multiple Giant Golems are at the Tower Bridge that leads to Divine Tower of Limgrave. This Location can be found on the map. [Map Link] Since Limgrave is the first Location available in the game, you can easily begin farming early game to level up your character. You can find a total of three Golems here, Two Golems and one Archer Golem. The Golems in the area respawn, so you can locate the closest Sites of Grace to rest at them then continue farming. There are two Sites of Grace in the area, cross over using Waygate to reach the Divine Tower of Limgrave Site of Grace or return to use the Limgrave Tower Bridge Site of Grace in order to get them to respawn and continue farming. \nThe Golems in this area suffer from friendly attacks as well, so one method of defeating them is baiting the Archer Golem to attack while you are lined up with the other Golems. For melee users, focus your attacks on its legs and these giants will stagger easily and eventually fall, giving you the opportunity to deal all your offensive attacks while it is incapacitated. \nOther Golem Notes\n\nDeals Standard (Halberd), Pierce (arrow) and Fire Damage. Variants from Caelid deals additional Magic Damage. \n\nThere is unique Golem from Caelid near "Redmane" painting location. This one uses halberd infused with magic and attacks with ranged attack dealing pure Magic Damage.\n\nWeaknesses: Unarmored body parts. Attacks there deals increased damage. \n\nDepending on variation, these are either its ankles, wrists, or chest.\nLate-game variation can be fully covered in armor, but poise-breaking them is still possible.\n\nCan't be parried, but can be poise broken. Poise break stuns them for a long time and allows to perform a riposte dealing massive damage (riposte is done to the chest)\nNeutral to Strike Damage, low resistance to other types of Physical-type damages/Magic Damage and medium to other Elemental-type damages.\nImmune to Status Effects.\nIt is recommended that you use a melee weapon (preferably a Heavy or Colossal Weapon) to bring the Golem down easily, by positioning yourself by the ankles, charge up your heavy attacks 2-3 times, the Golem will then fall down and give you the chance to deal crit damage. When it tries to stand up, position yourself again at the ankles before it could fully recover and repeat the process.\n\nGolem Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Creatures & Enemies\n\nAbductor Virgin  ♦  Abnormal Stone Cluster  ♦  Albinauric  ♦  Albinauric Wolfback Archer  ♦  Anastasia Tarnished-Eater  ♦  Ancestral Follower  ♦  Ancestral Follower Shaman  ♦  Avionette Soldier  ♦  Azula Beastman  ♦  Baleful Shadow  ♦  Banished Knight  ♦  Basilisk  ♦  Battlemage  ♦  Bear  ♦  Blackflame Monk  ♦  Bloody Finger Nerijus  ♦  Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin  ♦  Boar  ♦  Broken Statue  ♦  Burning Slug  ♦  Celebrant  ♦  Chanting Winged Dame  ♦  Chariot  ♦  Chief Guardian Arghanthy  ♦  Clayman  ♦  Colossal Fingercreeper  ♦  Commoner  ♦  Construct  ♦  Crab  ♦  Crystal Snail  ♦  Crystal Sorcerer  ♦  Deer  ♦  Demi-Human  ♦  Demi-Human Queen  ♦  Depraved Perfumer  ♦  Direwolf  ♦  Dog  ♦  Duelist  ♦  Eagle  ♦  Edgar the Revenger  ♦  Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm  ♦  Exile Soldier  ♦  Fallen Hawks Soldier  ♦  Farum Azula Dragon  ♦  Festering Fingerprint Vyke  ♦  Fingercreeper  ♦  Fire Monk  ♦  Fire Prelate  ♦  Flame Guardian  ♦  Frenzied Villager  ♦  Giant Ant  ♦  Giant Bat  ♦  Giant Crab  ♦  Giant Crayfish  ♦  Giant Dog  ♦  Giant Dragonfly  ♦  Giant Land Octopus  ♦  Giant Land Squirt  ♦  Giant Miranda Sprout  ♦  Giant Rat  ♦  Giant Skeletal Slime  ♦  Giant Skeleton (Spirit)  ♦  Glintstone Dragon  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer  ♦  Godrick Foot Soldier  ♦  Great Horned Tragoth  ♦  Great-Jar Warrior  ♦  Guardian  ♦  Guillemot  ♦  Haligtree Foot Soldier  ♦  Haligtree Knight  ♦  Haligtree Soldier  ♦  High Page  ♦  Highwayman  ♦  Inaba, Disciple of Okina  ♦  Inquisitor Ghiza  ♦  Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood  ♦  Kaiden Sellsword  ♦  Knight of Zamor  ♦  Land Octopus  ♦  Land Squirt  ♦  Lazuli Sorcerer  ♦  Lesser Alabaster Lord  ♦  Lesser Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Lesser Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Lesser Burial Watchdog  ♦  Lesser Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Lesser Dragonkin Soldier (Spirit)  ♦  Lesser Fingercreeper  ♦  Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)  ♦  Lesser Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Lesser Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Lesser Omenkiller  ♦  Lesser Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Lesser Runebear  ♦  Lesser Sanguine Noble  ♦  Lesser Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Lesser Wormface  ♦  Leyndell Foot Soldier  ♦  Leyndell Knight  ♦  Leyndell Soldier  ♦  Lion Guardian  ♦  Living Jar  ♦  Lone Wolf  ♦  Mad Tongue Alberich  ♦  Maleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan  ♦  Malformed Star  ♦  Man-Serpent  ♦  Mausoleum Foot Soldier  ♦  Mausoleum Knight  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier  ♦  Miner  ♦  Miranda Sprout  ♦  Misbegotten  ♦  Monstrous Crow  ♦  Mounted Knight  ♦  Nameless White Mask  ♦  Night Maiden  ♦  Noble Sorcerer  ♦  Nomad  ♦  Nox Monk  ♦  Nox Swordstress  ♦  Old Knight Istvan  ♦  Omen  ♦  Oracle Envoy  ♦  Oracle Envoy Giant  ♦  Owl  ♦  Page  ♦  Preceptor Miriam  ♦  Putrid Avatar  ♦  Putrid Corpse  ♦  Radahn Foot Soldier  ♦  Radahn Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Foot Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Knight  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier  ♦  Recusant Henricus  ♦  Redmane Knight  ♦  Revenant  ♦  Rileigh the Idle  ♦  Rotten Duelist  ♦  Scarlet Rot Zombie  ♦  School of Graven Mages  ♦  Serpent Snail  ♦  Servant of Rot  ♦  Sheep  ♦  Silver Tear  ♦  Skeletal Bandit  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman  ♦  Skeletal Slime  ♦  Skeletal Snail  ♦  Skeleton Mage  ♦  Skeletons  ♦  Slug  ♦  Soldier  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish  ♦  Spirit NPC  ♦  Springhare  ♦  Starcaller  ♦  Tanith's Knight  ♦  Teardrop Scarab  ♦  Thorn Sorcerer  ♦  Troll  ♦  Troll Knight  ♦  Turtle  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer  ♦  Unobtainable Items  ♦  Vargram the Raging Wolf  ♦  Vulgar Militant  ♦  Wandering Nobles  ♦  Warhawk  ♦  Wild Mouflon  ♦  Wraith Caller\n\n
