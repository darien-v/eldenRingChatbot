QUESTION
Why is the Veteran's Prosthesis considered a good weapon for Lightning damage builds in Elden Ring?

The Veteran's Prosthesis is considered a good weapon for Lightning damage builds in Elden Ring due to its high Lightning scaling of 53 and the inclusion of the Light element, making it effective for such builds.
