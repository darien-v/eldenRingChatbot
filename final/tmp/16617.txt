The Golem Greatbow scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for ranged combat. \n\nGreatbow of black stone crafted by a civilization now gone to ruin. Weapon of the Guardian Golem.Extremely heavy, this greatbow requires enormous strength just to draw, suggesting it was not designed for human use.\n\nWhere to Find Golem Greatbow in Elden Ring\nThe Golem Greatbow has a chance to drop from any Golem archer. The Golem Greatbow does not drop from Golems with halberds.\nLocations of respawning Golem archers:\n\nOne can be found on the Limgrave Tower Bridge in Stormhill, which can be accessed from Stormveil Castle. Two halberd Golems are also found on the bridge.\nTwo can be found on the path towards the colosseum in Caelid. This location is only accessible via a lift in the Siofra River that takes the player to the Deep Siofra Well. \n\nThese two Golem archers fire magic-imbued explosive arrows and are also the only source of Golem's Magic Arrow.\n\nOne can be found next to the top of the Grand Lift of Dectus, in the Altus Plateau. It is accompanied by a single halberd Golem. \n\nIf the Grand Lift of Dectus is activated after finding both halves of the Dectus Medallion, the Golems guarding the lift will be non-hostile until the the player initiates combat. (needs confirmation, not sure if the game checks for possession of the medallion or usage of the lift)\n\nLocations of non-respawning Golem archers:\n\nOne can be found outside the entrance of Castle Morne, at the southern tip of the Weeping Peninsula. [Elden Ring Map here]\nTwo can be found in the north-eastern section of the Capital Outskirts, on the hill approaching the northern entrance to Leyndell Royal Capital (Legacy Dungeon).\nOne can be found in the Mountaintops of the Giants, guarding the tall and narrow path north. \n\nElden Ring Golem Greatbow Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Through and Through\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nGolem Greatbow can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nFarming tips: \n\nWhen a Golem falls over, the player can perform a Critical Attack by attacking it's chest.\nThe best places to farm Golem archers for this greatbow are: \n\nThe pair of Golem archers in Caelid that are located on the path towards the colosseum. The player can fast travel to the Deep Siofra Well Site of Grace to respawn the archers. Note that the archer closer to the colosseum does not have weakspots in it's feet.\nThe Golem archer next to the Grand Lift of Dectus. The Altus Plateau Site of Grace is nearby, north of the lift.\n\nThe Limgrave Tower Bridge is an early game option, as the Golems here have less health than in other encounters. However, the player is unable to summon their mount at this location and the Golem archer spawns at the broken part of the bridge, near the Waygate to the the Divine Tower of Limgrave. Two halberd-wielding Golems also spawn along the way which can interfere with farming.\n\nSell Value:   200\nBase drop rate is 10% from the respawning Golems, and 5% from the non-respawning Golems (at 100 Discovery).\nYou can shoot greatbows fairly quickly if you jump and start firing midair. Your character will land with the bow already drawn and fire the arrow in a moment. Obviously much slower than long or short bows but still fast enough to use against bosses if you keep your distance.\nAll Bows (not Crossbows) only need 2/3 the STR requirement, since they can only be used two-handed.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
