Academy Glintstone Key is used to open the academy's two sealed gates. Key Items in Elden Ring include a wide variety of items found in specific locations or are given by a related NPCs which are used to unlock areas, quests, and to further progress the game's story.\n\nKey to the seals binding both gates to the Academy of Raya Lucaria.\nActivates warp magic bound within the seals.\nA glintstone key will remember its user, meaning once used it can never be passed on to another. The academy does not welcome the indolent.\n\nWhere to find Academy Glintstone Key in Elden Ring\nYou can find two of this key. Video Location\n1. Location: Liurnia of the Lakes, south from Crystalline Woods site of grace, behind Glintstone Dragon Smarag. See it on the map here\n2. Location: Raya Lucaria Academy, looted off a corpse located on a chandelier hanging on the Church of the Cuckoo's ceiling. To reach the ceiling, you can start from the Debate Parlor Site of Grace. Head out the door right in front of you and up the slope/destroyed staircase on your left.\n\nContinue on and, just before the shortcut where the 2 sorcerers are standing, turn left to face some stairs, then jump over the railing to reach them.\n\nWalk to the top of the stairs and turn left, jumping down again onto a rooftop.\n\nIf you continue on over the rooftops, until you find a ladder.\n\nClimb up the ladder and you'll reach a pathway guarded by a Glinstone Sorcerer at the end. Defeat him, then pass around the building on the right-hand side.\n\nFollowing the ledge along the right of the building, if you look down, you'll see another rooftop that you can jump down to.\n\nJump down onto it, then proceed until you can jump down onto the next one.\n\nOnce you've gotten down onto the second one, turn left (going West), and confirm you see an enemy with its back to a building. This is where you want to end up -- so to get here, you'll have to drop down two more levels.\n\nReach the enemy's location, and after defeating him, look down on the left side (so to it's right)  to where there is a small ledge (not a rooftop!) for you to jump down to.\n\nAfter jumping down onto the ledge, you should see a relatively large cathedral in front of you. You'll notice an enemy walks along its sloped roof, patrolling. Along the roof are several windows. One of these is open, which will allow you to gain access into the building. Proceed along the ledge, then jump to the roof where the enemy is.\n\nWalk along the roof until you reach the first open window. Jump over it and you'll land on some rafters. Looking to your lower left, you'll see chandeliers hanging from the rafters. The first one (closest to you), will have  corpose on it, with some loot.\n\nFrom here, you can simply walk along the rafters to where the chandelier is,  and then drop down onto the chandelier to pick up the key.\n\n [Map Coordinates]\n\nElden Ring Academy Glintstone Key Use\n\nAcademy Glintstone Key lets the player pass through both of the sealed gates of Academy of Raya Lucaria.\nThe second one found at the academy can be given to Thops who can be found at the Church of Irith.
