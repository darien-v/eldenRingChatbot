Including new Locations, Bosses, Armor, Weapons, Spells, and more!\n\nShadow of the Erdtree Reveal\n\nWhat to expect from the Shadow of the Erdtree Expansion\nGiven FromSoftware's previous releases and the fact that the expansion is being announced more than a year after Elden Ring's official launch, we speculate that this content is a fully-fledged expansion meant to add significant content to the game.\nUnlike the Colosseum Update, which featured content that had already been hinted at with the base game, the Shadows of the Erdtree expansion should feature entire new areas, weapons, equipment, bosses, and discoveries. The zone features on the image for the game are already different than any available in-game at the moment, and it is likely to expand on the Lore and background of the world.\nThe expansion features its own “mini logo” which is often a signal for a large content expansion, but the main driving force behind the content size speculation is the amount of time that it has taken FromSoftware to reveal that the content is in the works. We initially estimated that they must have been working on this for some time, announcing development in Feb 2023, and expect a launch date to be revealed around Q2 with a release date for Q3 or Q4 2023.\n\nNew Story\nGuided by Empyrean Miquella, players are beckoned to the Land of Shadow, a place obscured by the Erdtree where the goddess Marika first set foot. In these strange new lands, players discover the dark secrets of the world as they meet others who follow in Miquella’s footsteps with ulterior motives.\n\nNew Location\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree takes players beyond the Lands Between to explore the Land of Shadow, a completely new world from Elden Ring. Players can seamlessly travel back and forth between its vast maps interspersed with diverse situations and meticulous dungeons where menacing enemies roam.\n\nNew Content\nShadow of the Erdtree adds new Weapons, equipment, weapon skills and Magic not found in the base game ELDEN RING, along with new Enemies, Boss encounters and plotlines to further increase players' RPG freedom. Take on these threats with the new powers you can acquire.\n\nExpansion Speculations\nMiquella is officially said to be awaiting for a promised lord. This, coupled with the official narration that Miquella will be the Tarnished’s guide in the Land of Shadow, suggests that Miquella is planning to ascend to godhood with the Tarnished as the lord or consort. As such, Miquella may be a friendly NPC rather than a foe.\nMessmer the Impaler is unlikely to be Miquella. This is supported by the fact that Messmer refers to Miquella in third person when he said that the Tarnished, like others, is keen to know what Miquella is up to in the Land of Shadow. Furthermore, Messmer hunts anyone who is stripped of the Erdtree’s grace, whereas Miquella protects and shelters those who are without grace (such as Albinaurics). The “Mother” that Messmer mentioned is more likely to be Marika, because he asked why Marika chose a Tarnished without the Erdtree’s grace to be a lord (likely referring to the Age of Fracture or similar endings involving the Tarnished becoming a lord or consort to Marika). A land that was severed from the Lands Between, the Land of Shadow may possibly correspond to the part of the Elden Ring sealed away by Marika to achieve immortality. The tree in the Land of Shadow is covered by shadowy veils and may represent the sealed part of the Erdtree. At the end of the Shadow of the Erdtree trailer, as Miquella raises his hand, the tree radiates with light and is no longer covered by the veils.\nThe events in the Shadow of Erdtree likely occur in the present timeline and not in the past before the Erdtree came into being. This is because the Land of Shadow is a land that is overshadowed by the Erdtree (i.e., the Erdtree already came into existence).\nTowards the end of the trailer, the guiding voice said, “May we meet again”. We know based on official narration that Miquella will be the Tarnished’s guide in the Land of Shadow, but the Tarnished has never met Miquella. This may suggest that Miquella was guiding the Tarnished under the guise of Melina.\nMiquella is confirmed to have stripped himself of his flesh. This means that the physical body that Mohg was caring for in Mohgwyn Palace is nothing more than an empty shell. This is why Mohg received no response even with the constant pouring of blood into the body.\nOne theory posits that Miquella bewitched Mohg to befoul Miquella’s physical body with omen blood so that Miquella can rid himself of his Golden lineage. This may explain Mohg’s unnatural obsession with Miquella witnessed through his own monologues at the Mohgwyn Palace.\n\nELDEN RING SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE EDITIONS & PREORDER BONUSES\n\nPRE-ORDER BONUS FOR SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE\nBy preordering any of the two available editions for Shadow of the Erdtree, players will be able to obtain a special gesture called Ring of Miquella.\n\nSHADOW OF THE ERDTREE STANDARD EDITION & PREMIUM BUNDLE\nThere are two available editions for players to purchase :\n\nThe standard edition of Shadow of the Erdtree, which contains a copy of the DLC\nThe Premium Bundle edition of Shadow of the Erdtree, which contains a copy of the DLC, a Digital Artbook and the Original Soundtrack\n\nELDEN RING SHADOW OF THE EDTREE COLLECTOR'S EDITION\nFrom Software is also releasing a physical Collector's Edition for Shadow of the Erdtree, which contains the following:\n\nShadow of the Erdtree Voucher Code\nOfficial Soundtrack\n40 Page Hard-Cover Artbook\nA 46-cm statue of Messmer the Impaler\n\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Information\n\nNew Locations:\n\nLand of Shadow\n\nNew Bosses:\n\nMessmer the Impaler\n\nNew Weapons and Shields:\n\nTBD\n\nNew Ashes of War:\n\nTBD\n\nNew Spells:\n\nTBD\n\nNew Armor:\n\nTBD\n\nNew Items:\n\nTBD\n\nNew NPCs:\n\nTBD\n\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Faq\n\nWhen does Shadow of the Erdtree Come out?\nAs revealed on the gameplay trailer released on February 21st, Shadow of the Erdtree will release on June 21st, 2024\nIn Which platforms Shadow of the Erdtree will be available?\nShadow of the Erdtree is releasing on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC. Do note that Physical retail versions will be only available for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but not on the previous console generation (Playstation 4 and Xbox One)\nHow can Shadow of the Erdtree be Accessed?\nBoth Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood must be defeated to access the DLC when it is released. Players can then enter the DLC by interacting with the withering arm on the cocoon in Mohg's boss arena.\nDid George R. R. Martin provide new material for Shadow of the Erdtree?\nConfirmed by Miyazaki, Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin did not provide new material for the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. The DLC is based on one part of the mythos the american writer originally created for From Software during the base Elden Ring development.\n\nIs Shadow of the Erdtree a stand alone expansion?\nNo. Shadow of the Erdtree is a massive addition to the already inmense world of Elden Ring, and it requires players to have the original Elden Ring edition already installed. Players that don't possess the original game, WILL NOT be able to play Shadow of the Erdtree.\nWill there be more expansions after Shadow of the Erdtree?\nMiyazaki stated there are currently no plans for further DLC, although at the same time he claimed that doesn't mean everything in Elden Ring is complete and that he doesn't want to make any statements which close off future possibilities. From Software has a track record of releasing at least one paid DLC package for their games, but it remains to be seen if a second DLC comes after Shadow of the Erdtree.\nWhat will Shadow of the Erdtree difficulty level be?\nAccording to Miyazaki, the difficulty level is on a similar footing with the end game of the base game. Shadow of the Erdtree will also include a separate, limited to the DLC level up system affecting attack power so that even high level players may face new challenges and may enter or avoid areas based on enemy difficulty. He compared this to Attack Power in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and also stated it can be opted out of entirely for a greater challenge.\n\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Gallery\nImages and Artwork for the upcoming DLC (Click to open full size)\n\n
