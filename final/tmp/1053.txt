This allows to perform few attacks before he even try to summon.\nRiding Torrent during this fight is recommended to avoid Scarlet Rot build up\nYou can sneak up behind him and cast poison mist\nO'Neil cannot jump, so you can summon Latenna or use ranged bows on a tree branch to whittle him down. His crossbow summons in phase 1 will knock Latenna off the branch however, and his phase 2 summons can kill her. It is also possible for her to slowly inch forward and fall down within reach of O'Neil.\n\nMelee Users\nDirect Melee confrontation is possible, but it's much easier completing this fight on horseback. Employing a hit and run strategy will allow you to outrun Commander O'Neil's counter attacks as well as any attacks from his minions. This also has the added benefit of allowing you to travel outside the arena and avoid the scarlet rot build-up.\nKilling summoned Exile Crossbowmen and Exile Axe Soldiers is straightforward from horseback and can be performed without engaging with Commander O'Neil. Doing so will minimize the potential of being staggered or blindsided while attacking O'Neil and will simplify the fight. He will summon a second group of summons wielding axes during his second phase. Although they lack range, they will move towards you aggressively and will do more damage than the first group. However, they can also be dealt with relatively quickly on horseback.\nIf you want to beat him on foot, it is also doable, since most of his attacks are easily parryable. You just have to watch out for the summons and the Rot Storm.\nYou can kite him out to the nearby Site of Grace, then kite him through the Scarlet Rot geysers to damage him; he needs to be walking through the geyser when it erupts to take damage, the large pool of Scarlet Rot doesn't affect him.  He will teleport back to the starting point for his second phase, and can be kited out to the geysers again.  The second group of summons will likely follow him out, and that's a good time to use your Spirits to eliminate the summons.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nMagic users with long-ranged spells can easily outrange Commander O'Neil by fighting on horseback, trivializing the fight. He is a slow-moving boss that lumbers across the battlefield and makes no real effort to close the distance. Just make sure to clear his minions out whenever he summons them to avoid getting overwhelmed.\n\nCommander O'Neil Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nCall Spirits - Exile Crossbowmen\nCommander O'Neil will summon 5 Exile Crossbowmen to provide fire support at the beginning of the battle. Each has roughly 430 health.\nFirst, kite Commander O'Neil away from the archers while dodging or blocking their shots. Take the minions out before refocusing on the commander.\n\nCall Spirits - Exile Greataxe Soldiers\nCommander O'Neil will summon 3 Exile Axe Soldiers when he drops to 40% health. Each soldier has roughly 500 health.\nThe axe soldiers move faster than Commander O'Neil does. Keep away from Commander O'Neil as you deal with the axe men, while dodging out when he gets within striking distance.\n\nGlory, Brave Knights! - Offensive\nCommander O'Neil will swing his Commander's Standard around in the air and exhort his summons to fight on, boosting their attack speed. This buff takes the form of a little red mist around the enemies, indicating heightened offensive capacity.\nCommander O'Neil does not do this attack when he has no summons. Additionally, Commander O'Neil is vulnerable to attack when he enters this animation, so potentially this can prove to be a good opportunity for damage.\n\nGlory, Brave Knights! - Defensive\nCommander O'Neil will swing his Commander's Standard around in the air and exhorts his summons to fight defensively, boosting their resilience and giving them additional health. This buff manifests as a white glowing circle on enemies, and grants them additional resilience to damage as well as small amount of bonus health.\nCommander O'Neil does not do this attack when he has no summons. Additionally, Commander O'Neil is vulnerable to attack when he enters this animation, so potentially this can prove to be a good opportunity for damage. \n\nRotting Whirlwind\nCommander O'Neil will kneel, and the wind around him will begin to blow harder as it forms a large area of effect around him. Then, he will swing his standard three times, doing massive damage to anything still inside his area of effect and building up huge amounts of Scarlet Rot, practically guaranteeing a proc.\nThis attack takes about 4 seconds to come out, and if you're on horseback it's very easy to escape.\n\nSpearing Attack\nCommander O'Neil has a range of long-ranged attacks that can go from thrusts to slashes, he can mix these up from time to time and can sometimes chain it to the move Rotting Winds.\nYou can easily dodge roll away from any of the spear attacks. You can also try to parry these attacks as he swings his spear very slowly.\n\n Commander O'Neil Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThe summonable NPC Polyanna, Adopted Daughter also appears at the end of Millicent's quest line where she is named "Polyanna, Youngest Sister".\n\nCommander O'Neil Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
