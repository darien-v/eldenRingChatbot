They typically wield Forked Hatchets or Forked Greatswords, as well as throwing daggers and throwing pots that deal fire, magic, or lightning damage.\nThey are found largely in tombs and catacombs, and will attack trespassers with extreme prejudice. They typically lie in wait either by posing as harmless statues, waiting around corners, or clinging to walls and ceilings. Once they detect an intruder, they spring into action, jumping and scampering nimbly about to close in on their targets before relentlessly striking with their weapons, or else attacking from afar with throwing daggers or pots. With the exception of pots, all the weapons that Imps wield inflict Bleed damage.\nThe spirits of two (2) Fanged Head Imps can be summoned for aid in battle using the Fanged Imp Ashes.\n\nThese spirits are well suited to causing a disturbance, moving nimbly like pests and hurling magic pots.\n\nCombat Strategy\nImps are pesky little creatures that can quickly overwhelm the player if they're not careful. Most of them attack in groups of two or more, and their Bleed-inducing weapons combined with their rapid attacks can kill the player before they even completely fill their Hemorrhage bar. When exploring catacombs, players should be wary when walking through doorways or around corners, as there may be an imp lying in wait just out of sight ready to jump on the player or smack them with a greatsword. They can also be found lurking on higher-up ledges ready to attack with daggers and pots.\nFighting imps can be tricky- being made of stone, they are somewhat resistant to most attacks, and are immune to all status effects (Hemorrhage, Sleep, Frostbite, Madness, Poison, Scarlet Rot, and Death Blight). However, they take full damage against Strike-type damage, and are less resistant to Magic type attacks. In fact, one of the best weapons to use against imps are Crystal Darts: though they don't do a lot of damage by themselves, a couple hits with Crystal Darts will cause imps to "short-circuit" (indicated by the afflicted imp standing ramrod-straight and emitting blue sparks), making them go berserk and attack whoever is closest to them, friend or foe. This is especially useful to help kill off other enemies in the room with the short-circuited imp, or at the very least whittle them down for the player to take out more easily.\nImp Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to Find Imps:\n\nPlayers can encounter Imp within the dungeons and catacombs of Limgrave.\nImpaler's Catacombs\nTombsward Catacombs\nCliffbottom Catacombs\nMinor Erdtree Catacombs\nWyndham Catacombs\nMurkwater Catacombs\nFringefolk Hero's Grave\nRoad's End Catacombs\nAuriza Side Tomb\nOn the yellow rooftop of buildings south of East Capital Rampart site of grace in Leyndell, Royal Capital\nGiants' Mountaintop Catacombs\nConsecrated Snowfield Catacombs\n\nImp Combat Information\n\n   Tier 1 \n\n   Tier 2 \n\n   Tier 3 \n\n   Tier 4 \n\n   Tier 5 \n\n   Tier 6 \n\n   Tier 7 \n\n   Tier 8 \n\n   Tier 9 \n\n   Tier 10 \n\n   Tier 11 \n\nHealth: 196 HP\nRunes: 67 \nPoise: 30\nImmune to Poison, Scarlet Rot, Hemorrhage, Frostbite, Sleep, Madness and Death Blight\n\nAbsorptions\n\nPhy (Standard): 10\nPhy (Slash): 35\nPhy (Strike): 0\nPhy (Pierce): 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 40\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked.
