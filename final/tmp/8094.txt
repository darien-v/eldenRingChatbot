You'll soon enter a tunnel with a Stake of Marika in it. As soon as you reach the end of this tunnel, hug the right wall closely, and you'll pass 3 giant purple crystals on your left almost immediately. Walk up the third crystal, drop to another crystal facing south, then drop to a third crystal facing south-southwest. This crystal leads to a tunnel in the far wall. In that tunnel is a drop that leads directly into the room with the chest containing these ashes, protected by 3 sorcerers.\nThe entrance to Sellia Hideaway is located north of the Church of the Plague site of grace.
