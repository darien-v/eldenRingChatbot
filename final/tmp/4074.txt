In this scenario, were the player to die a second time before recovering their Runes, the Sacrificial Twig will be consumed and the original Runes will not be lost, as a ''second'' Rune recovery point will not be generated. Thus the player can try once again to recover their runes.\nImportant note: Does not prevent rune loss when dying to Death Blight. When afflicted by Death Blight, the Sacrificial Twig will remain equipped as if nothing had happened, and the player's Runes will be lost at their death's location as normal.\n\nElden Ring Talismans\n\nAncestral Spirit's Horn  ♦  Arrow's Reach Talisman  ♦  Arrow's Sting Talisman  ♦  Arsenal Charm  ♦  Assassin's Cerulean Dagger  ♦  Assassin's Crimson Dagger  ♦  Axe Talisman  ♦  Blessed Dew Talisman  ♦  Blue Dancer Charm  ♦  Blue-Feathered Branchsword  ♦  Boltdrake Talisman  ♦  Bull-Goat's Talisman  ♦  Carian Filigreed Crest  ♦  Cerulean Amber Medallion  ♦  Cerulean Seed Talisman  ♦  Clarifying Horn Charm  ♦  Claw Talisman  ♦  Companion Jar  ♦  Concealing Veil  ♦  Crimson Amber Medallion  ♦  Crimson Seed Talisman  ♦  Crucible Knot Talisman  ♦  Crucible Scale Talisman  ♦  Curved Sword Talisman  ♦  Daedicar's Woe  ♦  Dagger Talisman  ♦  Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman  ♦  Dragoncrest Shield Talisman  ♦  Entwining Umbilical Cord  ♦  Erdtree's Favor  ♦  Fire Scorpion Charm  ♦  Flamedrake Talisman  ♦  Flock's Canvas Talisman  ♦  Furled Finger's Trick-Mirror  ♦  Godfrey Icon  ♦  Godskin Swaddling Cloth  ♦  Golden Scarab  ♦  Graven-Mass Talisman  ♦  Graven-School Talisman  ♦  Great-Jar's Arsenal  ♦  Greatshield Talisman  ♦  Green Turtle Talisman  ♦  Haligdrake Talisman  ♦  Hammer Talisman  ♦  Hosts' Trick-Mirror  ♦  Immunizing Horn Charm  ♦  Kindred of Rot's Exultation  ♦  Lance Talisman  ♦  Lightning Scorpion Charm  ♦  Longtail Cat Talisman  ♦  Lord of Blood's Exultation  ♦  Magic Scorpion Charm  ♦  Marika's Scarseal  ♦  Marika's Soreseal  ♦  Millicent's Prosthesis  ♦  Moon of Nokstella  ♦  Mottled Necklace  ♦  Old Lord's Talisman  ♦  Pearldrake Talisman  ♦  Perfumer's Talisman  ♦  Prince of Death's Cyst  ♦  Prince of Death's Pustule  ♦  Radagon's Scarseal  ♦  Radagon's Soreseal  ♦  Radagon Icon  ♦  Red-Feathered Branchsword  ♦  Ritual Shield Talisman  ♦  Ritual Sword Talisman  ♦  Roar Medallion  ♦  Rotten Winged Sword Insignia  ♦  Sacred Scorpion Charm  ♦  Shabriri's Woe  ♦  Shard of Alexander  ♦  Silver Scarab  ♦  Spear Talisman  ♦  Spelldrake Talisman  ♦  Stalwart Horn Charm  ♦  Starscourge Heirloom  ♦  Taker's Cameo  ♦  Twinblade Talisman  ♦  Two Fingers Heirloom  ♦  Viridian Amber Medallion  ♦  Warrior Jar Shard  ♦  Winged Sword Insignia\n\n
