Bosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Great Enemy bosses can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items. This is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, doing so yields useful items, as well as Runes.\nLesser Dragon is the normal enemy form of this boss. Other bosses with the same basic attacks are Flying Dragon Greyll, Decaying Ekzykes, Glintstone Dragon Smarag, Glintstone Dragon Adula, and Borealis the Freezing Fog. Glintstone Dragon is a normal enemy with the same basic attacks.\n\nThe dead gazed at the skies over the lakes of Limgrave, praying that the dragons' flames would burn them to ash.\n\nWhere to find Flying Dragon Agheel in Elden Ring\nThe Flying Dragon Agheel boss can be found at the Dragon-Burnt Ruins in Limgrave, the ruins can be found around the center area of Agheel Lake. This is an optional boss, the dragon will spawn when approaching the the small island northwest of the actual ruins site, with a bonfire and some followers there.

Speak to him after attacking and dying to Flying Dragon Agheel at least once, and he'll chastise you for trying to fight it. His summon sign will then be available next to the Stake of Marika for Flying Dragon Agheel\n\nFlying Dragon Agheel Combat information\n\nHealth: 3,200 HP \nDefense: 106\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\nAfter taking a critical hit, takes an additional 20% standard damage for the rest of the fight\nDamage: Standard, Fire\n Dragon type\nWeak spot: head (+50% damage)\nDrops 5,000, Dragon Heart\nDefeating Agheel unlocks Agheel's Flame at the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in Caelid\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 35\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 35\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 526 / 816 / 1273\nScarlet Rot: 526 / 816 / 1273\nHemorrhage: 526 / 816 / 1273\nFrostbite: 526 / 816 / 1273\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

In addition to increasing the boss's HP, co-op will prevent you from riding Torrent\nTry to hit its head whenever possible for bonus damage\nUse Rock Sling for its high stance damage\nUse Dragonwound Grease for 30% bonus damage\n\nMelee Strategies\nKnight vs Dragon: Stay on Torrent and ride in and out, swiping at his wings and feet as you go by but always staying on the move. Staying on Torrent has a number of benefits: you can quickly close distance when Agheel flies away, you can more easily maneuver out of the way of breath attacks, and you can wear the heaviest armor you have without penalty. But you won't be able to land heavy attacks or easily hit the dragon's head, and the lack of a proper dodge makes it dangerous to stay beneath its legs.\nHeads Up: Agheel's head takes bonus damage, so focus on trying to land hits on it. Spears and Great Spears are great weapon options, since dragons are weaker to pierce damage, but anything with long reach will do. Stand in front of the boss—most of its forward-facing attacks can be punished with a hit on the head (see Attacks & Counters for details). Its most dangerous attacks from this position are Strafe and Retreat, so if you see it fly up into the air with fire at its mouth start running as quickly as you can. You can also mount up first if you can react in time for Torrent's extra speed to make up for the mounting time.\nFootsies: Many of Agheel's attacks can be avoided by simply running towards its feet. Although they don't take as much damage as its head, they're much easier to get in hits on. If you're going for this strategy, it's important to learn the timing of its High and Low Stomp attacks—if you can reliably jump attack over the shockwaves, you'll be able to keep up the pressure even when the dragon tries to punish you for staying out of range of its bites. You'll still need to be ready to run as soon as it starts a flying breath attack, though.\n\nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nRide & Range: Stay on Torrent a few lengths away from Agheel's, lock on, and pepper it with ranged attacks. You have the advantage of being able to reliably target its head for bonus damage, but be aware that its attacks can cover a lot of ground quickly to time your shots carefully and be ready to back off further if necessary. Some attacks, like Sweeping/Tracking Breath and Charge are most easily dodged if you ride towards the dragon, so don't be afraid to go in and then come back out to prepare for more attacks.\n\nShield Up: If you are on foot, bring a good shield for your right hand. It'll be a lot harder for you to get out of the way when Agheel really wants to close in on you, so being able to block a physical attack as a backup option will help keep you alive.\n\nAttacks & Counters\n\nLow Stomp\nKeeping its head and wing high, raises one foot up to about the level of the other knee, then stomps it down to the ground, creating a small shockwave\nMove a few paces away, then do a jump attack towards the other leg when its tail dips down and its leg begins to fall\n\nHigh Stomp\nKeeping its head and wing low, raises one foot up to the level of its hips, then stomps it down to the ground, creating a small shockwave\nMove a few paces away, then do a jump attack towards the other leg when its tail dips down and its leg begins to fall\n\nLunging Stomp\nPivots its right foot back, puts its right talon on the ground, raises its left foot feet, and stomps forwards, creating a large shockwave around the area of impact\nThe easiest option is to run forward, get underneath it, and start attacking its back legs. Alternatively, sprint backwards and stand along the center line of Agheel's body. As it stomps, charge a heavy attack and release it as its head comes down.\n\nBite\nLowers its head and bends it in one direction, opening its mouth and roaring. Then bites in the opposite direction to the one it bent its head\nEither roll forward as you see it start raising its wings, sprint forwards as soon as you see it open its mouth to avoid the attack entirely, or step back out of range and prepare a charged heavy attack as it lowers its head following the second bite\n\nWing Slam\nTakes a step back, pulls back the wing on the same side, then slams the front of it down\nEither run forward when you see it step back and attack its feet; or run in the opposite direction from where it stepped, then turn around once the slam happens to get in a hit on its head\n\nWing Sweep\nPulls back one wing, then sweeps it across the ground\nEither run forward when you see it pull its wing back and attack its feet; or run in the opposite direction from the wing it pulls back, then turn around once the slam happens to get in a hit on its head\n\n Charge\nRoars, then runs forwards, lowering its head to its right as it goes. After taking two steps forward, swings its head counterclockwise and up to gore you with its horn\nIt doesn't do any damage until its head starts swinging, so sprint forward and get near its feet\n\nTail Whip\nCurls its tail clockwise, then stretches it out and spins counterclockwise. Usually used when you're behind Agheel\nRoll clockwise as you see the tail coming at you. If you're mounted, you can double jump to save yourself, but Torrent will probably get killed\n\nSpin Bite\nTurns its head clockwise to look behind it, opens its mouth, and then bites at the player. Usually used when you're behind Agheel\nEither run forward towards its feet when you see it turn around, or roll when you see its mouth coming at you\n\nWhip & Gore\nCurls its tail clockwise and lifts its right wing, then spins around to face the player, sweeping their tail counterclockwise and then sweeping their head counterclockwise shortly afterwards. Usually used when you're behind Agheel\nRoll backwards and to your left through the tail whip and you'll be out of range for the gore and able to attack the head\n\nRepositioning Hop\nLeaps into the air and glides a short distance before landing, turning around to face the player as they do so\nSprint towards Agheel\n\nDive Bomb\nLeaps backwards into the sky and hovers for three wingbeats (including liftoff), then dives down to land on you, creating a small shockwave as it lands\nCount three wingbeats, then roll as Agheel begins to drop. After you recover from the roll, sprint towards the head and land a jumping attack on the snout\n\nSweeping Breath\nArches its neck, then breathes a gout of flame clockwise for a long distance in front of it. Usually used when you're far away\nSprint forwards, ideally on Torrent, bearing left to give yourself as much time as possible. Hit its head if you have time before the attack completes\n\nTracking Breath\nArches its neck, then breathes a gout of flame directly at you, slowly following you as you move. Usually used when you're far away\nSprint diagonally forwards, ideally on Torrent. Hit its head if you have time before the attack completes\n\nRetreat\nLeaps backwards into the air and hovers there, spewing flame on the ground in a wide radius\nSprint directly away. If you don't react in time, you can mount Torrent and he'll absorb most of the flame. Once the fire has dissipated, run back towards Agheel\n\nStrafe\nLeaps backwards into the air with its body at a noticeable angle. Flies directly forward, spewing a jet of fire to its left that covers a large amount of ground\nSprint to your left as quickly as you can, ideally on Torrent, and try to outrun the fire. Once it's finished, run back towards the dragon. If you're close enough when the attack starts, you can also run underneath the dragon to avoid the attack entirely\n\nElden Ring Flying Dragon Agheel Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nAgheel and Greyll are the only two flying dragons who share the same moveset with no noticeable differences\nAgheel is one of the five named dragons who do not have a specified gender (the other four being Borealis the Freezing Fog, Flying Dragon Greyll, Glintstone Dragon Adula, and Magma Wyrm Makar)\nAgheel can damage and be damaged by the large crabs in the swamp nearby\nAgheel's Flame suggests that the various Wandering Nobles are praying to the dragon in hopes that it will free them from undeath\nAgheel was part of the closed network test from before Elden Ring was released\n\nFlying Dragon Agheel Combo Chart\n\nFlying Dragon Agheel Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
