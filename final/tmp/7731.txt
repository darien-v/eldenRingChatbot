Discus of Light spell deals holy damage in a AoE. Updated to Patch 1.07.\n\nOne of the incantations of the Golden Order fundamentalists.\nProduces a ring of light and fires it forwards. The ring of light returns to a position close to the caster before disappearing. This incantation can be cast repeatedly.\nA gift from the young Miquella to his father, Radagon.\n\nWhere to find Discus of Light\n\nPurchase from Brother Corhyn  for 11,000 runes after he moves to Goldmask's location at Altus Plateau.\n\nElden Ring Discus of Light Guide\n\nGolden Order Incantation\nStamina Cost: 20 [outdated as of 1.07, needs updating]\nDeals holy damage and 4 stance damage.\nNote: Significantly buffed in Patch 1.07 - FP cost reduced from 9 to 3, cast speed has been increased and the halo is now faster, lasts longer and has more range. In addition, stamina cost has been reduced.\nThe caster can use a spell parry such as Carian Retaliation or Golden Retaliation to deflect a returning discus and proc the effect of the spell parry used.\nThe disc is thrown from the height of the character's face, but for some reason it returns to the thighs, so be wary of low objects and ledges if you're trying to parry it.\nCasting it will make the PC take a step forward. Some ledges will prevent the caster from over-stepping and falling off. You can use this to guarantee the disc doesn't break on a ledge when you're trying to parry it. It's a mechanic inherited from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.\nOn the send stroke it passes through enemies and stops upon hitting any obstacle. It can damage an enemy once.\nOn the return stroke it passes through enemies and is destroyed by any obstacle. It can damage an enemy once.\nIf it contacts an enemy with a shield, the shield will reduce the damage [Needs testing to determine if it reduces the damage of the disc or the damage taken by the specific enemy, and testing to determine if it's dependent on the shield facing the caster. The phrasing was unclear].\nHorse-casting it lets Torrent trot, giving you more mobility.\nWhile not locked on, it exhibits the obnoxious horizontal dead angle aim "assist" (sabotage) many other projectiles have. If the angle you're firing at is mostly horizontal, it'll turn completely horizontal, making it impossible to hit most things horizontally in front of you, rendering free aiming worthless most of the times.\n\nGolden Sword Sage Written Guide\n\nElden Ring Discus of Light Notes and Tips\nUpdated to patch 1.07.
