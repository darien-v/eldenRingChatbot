CONTEXT
\nSomber Smithing Stones are Upgrade Materials in Elden Ring. Somber Smithing Stones are used to upgrade unique Weapons and Shields. This page covers a full list of all the Somber Smithing Stones in Elden Ring which includes information regarding description, location, and usage.\nYou can visit the Upgrades page to learn more about the Upgrade Mechanics of Elden Ring.\n\nHow to use Somber Smithing Stones\nSomber Smithing Stones can be used to upgrade unique equipment up to +10 (For upgrading regular equipment, please visit Smithing Stones). You'll need to visit a Blacksmith and have the correct level of Somber Smithing Stone in correlation to the current level of your weapon.\nTotal upgrade cost\nFor special upgrades 1 Somber Smithing Stone is required for each upgrade level.\n\nWhere to find Somber Smithing Stones?\nSmithing Stones can be acquired through exploration, you can visit our Interactive Map and filter by "Upgrade Material" for a complete list. You can also visit the individual Somber Smithing Stone pages listed in the table below for a complete list of locations.\n\nSmithing Master Iji sells a wide variety of Somber Smithing Stones\n\nTotal Number Needed\nThere are a total of 127 Weapons and 10 Shields in the game that utilize Somber Smithing Stones, and you would need 137 of each to fully upgrade everything. Due to the limited number of Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones, this would require you to reach NG+ 17 (18 playthroughs).\n\nHow to get an early max level unique weapon in Elden Ring\n[Note: As of patch 1.04, the volcano manor jump skip for Somber Smithing Stone 7 was patched, making a +9 weapon early unreliable]\nIt is possible to get a +9 unique weapon at the start of the game without defeating any bosses; it just requires some exploration and running away from enemies. From the First Step Grace, follow the road north to the Gatefront Ruins then head east. Cross the bridge to get to a cliff overlooking the northeastern part of Lake Agheel. Sitting on a chair on this cliff is a corpse with a Somber Smithing Stone (1) on it. Head back on the road and follow it south into the Weeping Peninsula. After crossing the Bridge of Sacrifice, keep following the road south to approach Castle Morne. After grabbing the map for the area, split off the path to the left (towards the southeast) and head down onto the beach. The red jellyfish here are guarding a corpse in the water with a Somber Smithing Stone (2).\nTeleport back to the Gatefront Ruins and follow the road northwest. At the end of the collapsed bridge, jump down to the cliffside on the left and follow the path up to Liurnia of the Lakes. Grab the Lake-Facing Cliffs grace and make your way north towards the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Grab the Academy Glintstone Key from behind Smarag and enter the academy. Make a beeline for the Church of the Cuckoo Grace just in case you get defeated. Behind the altar in the previous room is a Somber Smithing Stone (3).\nRun through the dungeon, past the graveyard, and onto the large waterwheel-like lift. Get grabbed and killed by the Abductor Virgin at the bottom to be taken to Volcano Manor. Instead of following the path here to the Subterranean Inquisition Chamber, you’ll want to jump down onto the lava below. To the left of the lava waterfall, is a large pile of rocks, and to the left of these rocks is a slight protrusion in the floor. If you jump to the left of the protrusion and surf the wall just right, you won’t take and fall damage and can run through the lava to a safe platform with a Burning Slug. Head southwest towards the ruined buildings and climb up the slope you see to your left to get to an area with many cages and cage lifts. Scale the roofs to the southwest to find a corpse with a Somber Smithing Stone (6).\nJump down onto the lava level and go back up the slope to the cage area. Head up the northeastern cage lift and to the right is a Somber Smithing Stone (5). Head up the stairs, making sure to avoid getting hit by the enemy here. Activate the bridge shortcut in the northwest to be able to reach the next smithing stone. You'll find a corpse on the balcony at the far end of the bridge. You can jump up there by jumping from the small iron piece on the side of the bridge to the chain wheel. From the chain wheel, you can then jump up onto the balcony to grab the Somber Smithing Stone (7). (Note that as of Patch 1.04 this jump got patched and is near impossible, requiring tremendous effort. It's recommended to instead cheese the godskin noble with sleeping status effects). Interact with any Site of Grace in the area to be able to leave afterwards. You can be defeated to get back up to the ledge that leads to the Subterranean Inqusition Chamber Site of Grace. \nTeleport back to Gatefront Ruins and make your way south to the Dragon-Burnt Ruins in Lake Agheel. Interact with the chest to get teleported to the Sellia Crystal Tunnel. In the tunnel, you’ll find multiple Somber Smithing Stone (4)s. In the main chamber, head up the slope until you are able to jump on the roof of the central storage shed. Jump onto the wooden platform in the east and hop over the barricade blocking the tunnel. Go through the tunnel until you end up in a room with a ladder and wooden walkways above. A stone is found on a body on one of the walkways.\nExit the tunnel and make your way towards the Divine Tower of Caelid in Dragonbarrow. On a small dead branch just before you get to the tower, you’ll find a Teardrop Scarab that drops a Somber Smithing Stone (8) (careful it explodes). Follow the cliff here southeast and when you get to the lower cliff ledge, head north on this lower ledge to find a group of corpses sitting on chairs, one of which has a Somber Smithing Stone (9).\nThe quickest way to get an Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone is by doing Varre's quest. You will have to kill at least one shardbearer to progress his quest, but with up to 9 Somber Smithing Stones, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem. Finish Varre’s quest to receive the Pureblood Knight's Medal (you can get maiden blood from the dead maiden in the Church of Inhibition). Using it takes you to the Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Grace. Progress through the mausoleum, running and doing your best to dodge enemies attacks until you reach the next Site of Grace, Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint. From the grace, you should be able to see a large statue surrounded by many Albinaurics and a Sanguine Noble. In front of that statue is a chest with a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone in it. It may take a death or two to open it if you’re low level at this point.\n\nSomber Smithing Stones Table for Elden Ring\n\nQuick Search of All Somber Smithing Stones\n\nSpecial\nUpgrade material\nUnit costs in runes\nCumulative costs in runes\n\nTo +1\n Somber Smithing Stone (1) \n2,000\n2,000\n\nTo +2\n Somber Smithing Stone (2) \n3,000\n5,000\n\nTo +3\n Somber Smithing Stone (3) \n4,000\n9,000\n\nTo +4\n Somber Smithing Stone (4) \n6,000\n15,000\n\nTo +5\n Somber Smithing Stone (5) \n9,000\n24,000\n\nTo +6\n Somber Smithing Stone (6) \n12,000\n36,000\n\nTo +7\n Somber Smithing Stone (7) \n16,000\n52,000\n\nTo +8\n Somber Smithing Stone (8) \n20,000\n72,000\n\nTo +9\n Somber Smithing Stone (9) \n25,000\n97,000\n\nTo +10\n Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone \n-\n97,000\n\n
