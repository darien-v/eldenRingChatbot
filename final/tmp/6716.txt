CONTEXT
\nStance is a hidden enemy-only Stat in Elden Ring. It governs how well an enemy can resist collapsing under your attacks.\nSee also Poise for the related player-character stat that governs when a player is staggered by incoming attacks. Players often casually refer to 'Poise' and 'Stance' as different terms, but that's technically the same mechanic, although stance normally refers to the PvE or enemy-only version of poise.\nStance in Elden Ring\n\nStance Basics\n\nEvery attack that hits an enemy deals a certain amount of stance damage. How much stance damage is dealt per hit is hidden from players, and isn't always closely related to the amount of HP the attack removes from the enemy. Once an enemy's total stance damage is higher than their Stance stat, they become stance-broken. This usually renders the enemy vulnerable to a critical hit, making a golden glow appear at a spot on their bodies, where you should stand to deliver the critical hit. Other enemies don't provide a critical hit opportunity and instead have a stance-break animation that will interrupt any attacks they're doing and provide you a chance to get in some free attacks.\nAfter some time taking no damage, an enemy's Stance will begin to recover. Different enemies take varying amounts of time to start recovering, but once they do they all recover their stance damage very quickly. If you're trying to break an enemy's Stance be sure to keep the pressure on. Projectiles like Throwing Daggers can help preserve your damage if the enemy retreats.\nAlthough parries generally have the same effect as breaking an enemy's Stance, they have a separate counter and don't actually do any stance damage. Parrying an enemy won't reset its stance damage meter, and stance-breaking an enemy won't reset its parry counter.\nStance Damage From Skills\n\nSkills that deal damage will also deal stance damage. Below are some skills that inflict particularly large amounts of stance damage:\n\nNebula (Wing of Astel): \n\n13 per explosion; typically hits 3-4 times resulting in 39-52 stance damage\n\nThundercloud Form: \n\n6 per tick inside cloud (ticks once uncharged, ticks 6 times fully charged)\n11 (final hit), 33 (final hit when charged)\nMaximum of 17 stance damage uncharged, 69 stance damage fully charged\n\nImpaling Thrust: \n\n30 (w/ Straight Swords, Katanas, Twinblades, Spears, and Halberds)\n33 (w/ Greatswords, Heavy Thrusting Swords, and Great Spears)\n\nSquare Off: 40 (heavy attack), 30 (light attack)\nHoarah Loux's Earthshaker: 15 (initial roar), 20 (each successive slam)\nGlintblade Phalanx: 10 per blade, 40 total\nCarian Grandeur: 20, 30 (charged once), 45 (fully charged)\nStamp (Upward Cut): \n\n30 (w/ Axes)\n33 (w/ Greatswords, Curved Greatswords, Heavy Thrusting Swords, and Greataxes)\n36 (w/ Flails, Colossal Weapons (non-Hammers), and Colossal Swords)\n39 (w/ Hammers)\n42 (w/ Great Hammers)\n45 (w/ Colossal Weapons (Hammers))\n\nLion's Claw: \n\n30 (w/ Straight Swords, Curved Swords, Katanas, Twinblades, and Axes)\n33 (w/ Greatswords, Curved Greatswords, and Greataxes)\n36 (w/ Flails, Colossal Weapons (non-Hammers), and Colossal Swords)\n39 (w/ Hammers)\n42 (w/ Great Hammers)\n45 (w/ Colossal Weapons (Hammers))\n\nUnsheathe: 30 (heavy attack)\nUnblockable Blade: 30\nTroll's Roar: 40 (initial roar), 33-45 (follow-up, varies on weapon class) \n\n33 w/ Greatswords, Greataxes\n36 w/ Colossal Swords, Colossal Weapons (non-Hammers)\n42 w/ Great Hammers\n45 w/ Colossal Weapons (Hammers)\n\nSince stance damage doesn't depend on your character's stats at all, and Skills don't have any stat requirements beyond those of the weapon they're attached to, they're one of the most effective ways to stance-break enemies.\n\nStance Damage in Melee\n\nHeavier melee weapons usually inflict more stance damage, and different types of attacks with a given weapon deal different amounts of stance damage. The precise details vary from weapon to weapon (see below for a full table), but in general:\n\nFully charged heavy attacks and guard counters deal the most stance damage.\nJumping heavy attacks deal a very large amount of stance damage.\nUncharged heavy attacks deal a large amount of stance damage.\nLight attacks deal the least stance damage.\n\nRunning attacks typically deal the same stance damage as their corresponding standing attack. However, the running heavy attacks on Greatswords, Great Spears, Greataxes, and Great Hammers will deal less stance damage than their standard heavy attack. \nStance Damage From Magic\n\nAny spell that deals damage also inflicts stance damage, and some are particularly effective at it:\n\nThe flame of frenzy: 56\nDragonmaw: 45\nAspects of the Crucible: Tail: 13 (first swing), 39 (second swing); 52 total\nAspects of the Crucible: Horns: 17 (uncharged), 30 (charged)\nDragonclaw: 30\nRock Sling: ~10 per rock, 29 total\nGavel of Haima: 23\n\nStance Modifiers\n\nEnemies who haven't noticed you take 20% more stance damage.\nWielding a weapon with both hands generally increases stance damage by 30% for light attacks and 10% for heavy attacks and guard counters. This does not apply to skills. \n\nThe charged heavy attacks on the Duelist/Rotten Greataxe, Dragon Greatclaw, Axe of Godfrey, and Troll's Hammer do not benefit from two-handing. This is likely a bug, since guard counters do receive this bonus.\n\nCertain enemies have weak points that take extra stance damage. For example, Golems' ankles take double the amount of stance damage than other parts of its body do.\nBosses take 40% less stance damage if you summon another player or an NPC. (Spirit Ashes don't impose a Stance penalty.)\nStonebarb Cracked Tear: +30% stance damage.\nStarting in NG+2, all enemies take reduced stance damage. See New Game Plus page for details.\n\nStance Damage by Weapon Type\nNote: These are averages. Values are slightly inaccurate due to rounding, and some weapons have different values from the rest of their class. This table provides a general idea of how much stance damage you'll be dealing.These values are for one-handed weapons. Remember that two-handing increases the stance damage of light attacks by +30%, and heavy attacks/guard counters by 10%.\n\nWeapon Type\nLight Attack\nJumping Light\nHeavy Attack\nJumping Heavy\nCharged Heavy\nPower Attack\nJumping Power Attack\nGuard Counter\n\n Colossal Weapons (Hammers)*\n18\n18\n15\n28\n42\n22\n33\n42\n\nColossal Weapons, Colossal Swords\n15\n15\n15\n24\n36\n18\n29\n36\n\nGreat Hammers\n13\n13\n17\n26\n40\n16\n31\n42\n\nGreatswords, Curved Greatswords, Greataxes, and Great Spears\n11\n11\n11\n22\n33\n13\n27\n33\n\nHalberds and Reapers\n9\n9\n10\n20\n30\n12\n15\n30\n\nFlails  and Hammers\n6\n9\n12\n24\n36\n8\n29\n36\n\nHeavy Thrusting Swords\n6\n9\n11\n22\n33\n7\n27\n33\n\nStraight Swords, Curved Swords, Axes, Spears, Twinblades, and Katanas\n5\n8\n10\n20\n30\n6\n15\n30\n\nFists\n5\n8\n10\n20\n30\n6\n9\n30\n\nThrusting Swords\n4\n6\n8\n16\n24\n5\n12\n24\n\nWhips\n4\n6\n8\n16\n16\n5\n12\n30\n\nDaggers and Claws\n3\n5\n6\n12\n18\n6\n9\n18\n\nSmall Shields\n5\n8\n10\n20\n30\n-\n-\n30\n\nMedium Shields\n6\n9\n11\n22\n33\n-\n-\n33\n\nGreatshields\n12\n12\n12\n24\n36\n-\n-\n36\n\n* Applies to Giant-Crusher, Prelate's Inferno Crozier, Great Club, Troll's Hammer, Watchdog's Staff, Staff of the Avatar, Rotten Staff, Envoy's Greathorn, and Fallingstar Beast Jaw. These weapons deal notably more stance damage than the rest of their class, and are thus separated.\n

QUESTION
Why is understanding the concept of Stance versus Poise important for players in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Understanding the concept of Stance versus Poise is important for players in Elden Ring because it helps them effectively break enemies' stance to create openings for critical hits and optimize their combat strategy by leveraging the game mechanics related to enemy resistance.
