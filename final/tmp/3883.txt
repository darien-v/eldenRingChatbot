CONTEXT
\n\n Taunter's Tongue \n\nType\nReusable\n\nEffect \n\n Lures in invaders \n\nTaunter's Tongue is a Multiplayer Item in Elden Ring. Multiplayer Items allow players to interact with each other in various ways, including leaving messages for other players to read, co-operative gameplay and competitive gameplay like PVP.\n\nItem for online play. (Can also be used from the Multiplayer menu.)\nLures in invaders. This allows your world to be invaded without any Furled Finger cooperators present, and it also shortens the interval between windows of opportunity for invasion.\nAdditionally, enables the arrival of a second invader to join when a cooperator is present. (With two invaders, the maximum number of cooperators becomes one.)\n\nTaunter's Tongue Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to find Taunter's Tongue:\n\nDropped by an invading spirit, Mad Tongue Alberich, within the Roundtable Hold. \n\nUpon arriving or teleporting in via Table of Lost Grace, run around the left of the table and go through the second opening you see. This will bring you to an area with a raised balcony and a lower floor below. Jump down to the lower floor to get invaded by Mad Tongue Alberich.\n\nAvailable by default during the Network Test.\n\nElden Ring Taunter's Tongue Guide\n\nBeckons Bloody Fingers and Recusants to come invade your world.\nThis allows you to be invaded even without a Furled Finger cooperator present, and reduces the amount of time before re-invasion is possible. However, you still need to use a Furlcalling Finger Remedy.\nIt also allows for a second invader to join multiplayer. (With two invaders, the maximum number of cooperators becomes one.)\nBoth invaders can be summoned via duelist signs, enabling free-for-alls or "fight clubs" (where the invaders duel each other instead).\n\nNotes & Trivia\n\nYou can gain access to Leyndell Royal Capital with this item and the help of another player. Activate it near the lift at the Divine Bridge site of grace after using the teleport trap at the Tower of Return. The Invader or Hunter will likely spawn at the bottom of the lift; If they use the lever to summon the lift, you will be able to use it to get to Leyndell. This can allow you to easily gain access without beating the bosses required to get in via the usual means.\nSimilar in function to the Dried Finger in Dark Souls. However, unlike the Dried Finger, the Taunter's Tongue does not unlock additional summon slots, as you can already summon the max number of cooperators without it (2). Furthermore, the tongue can be turned off, regardless of whether or not you are in multiplayer. \n\nThe community scorns those who abuse and turn off the Taunter's Tongue. Use it at your own discretion\n\nElden Ring Multiplayer Items\n\nBloody Finger  ♦  Blue Cipher Ring  ♦  Duelist's Furled Finger  ♦  Festering Bloody Finger  ♦  Finger Severer  ♦  Furlcalling Finger Remedy  ♦  Grace Mimic  ♦  Phantom Bloody Finger  ♦  Recusant Finger  ♦  Scriptstone  ♦  Small Golden Effigy  ♦  Small Red Effigy  ♦  Tarnished's Furled Finger  ♦  Tarnished's Wizened Finger  ♦  White Cipher Ring\n\n
