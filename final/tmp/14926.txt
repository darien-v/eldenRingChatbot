After resting, he moves to Altus Plateau and increases the number of Incantations he knows. Corhyn will be standing on the road north of the Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace, next to the monument where the Map (Altus Plateau) can be found. [Map Link] If you find Corhyn dead at any point in the questline, you can still complete the steps with Goldmask.\nOn the north side of Altus Plateau, there is a large broken bridge. You can encounter Goldmask standing on the north section of the Forest-Spanning Great Bridge, south of East Windmill Pasture. \n\nTraveling north of the Bower of Bounty grace, you can use a Spirit Spring near the bridge to jump directly up to the Goldmask.\nAlternatively, use the waygate on the southern section of the Forest-Spanning Great Bridge, next to the Forest-Spanning Great Bridge Site of Grace.\n\nAfter speaking to the Goldmask, you can return to Corhyn and inform him of Goldmask's location. After resting, Corhyn moves to stand next to the Goldmask and adds new incantations to his stock. You can discuss Goldmask with him.\nAfter obtaining at least two Great Runes and gaining access to Leyndell, Corhyn and Goldmask move to the city Leyndell, and are found on a cliff east of the colosseum, contemplating a riddle. From the West Capital Ramparts Site of Grace, head overall south, along the balcony. The balcony will lead to a stone pathway, and upwards to the colosseum. Follow the path, dealing with the two Duelists along the way. From the top of the path, head left until you find the pair. Exhaust Corhyn's dialogue about Goldmask. [Map Link]  \n\nNote that in order to progress his questline you need to solve this riddle before burning the Erdtree at Forge of the Giants (after Fire Giant boss fight), otherwise Corhyn will vanish and leave behind Corhyn's Bell Bearing in Leyndell. In addition, Goldmask will not be present.\nThe solution is found west of the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace, down an elevator and a set of stairs. A white message on the ground facing the statue mentions "Regression". You must stand on the message, facing the statue, and cast the Law of Regression incantation to solve the riddle. Touch the new message that appears, and report the secret to Goldmask and then exhaust Corhyn's dialogue. \nCasting Law of Regression requires 37 Intelligence. If desired, you can use two Larval Tears to respec your character and back just to solve the riddle. Alternatively, you can use a combination of intelligence-boosting equipment and effects:\n\n(Helm) Haima Glintstone Crown (+2 INT)\n(Helm) Hierodas Glintstone Crown (+2 INT)\n(Helm) Imp Head (Cat) (+2 INT)\n(Helm) Karolos Glintstone Crown (+3 INT)\n(Helm) Olivinus Glintstone Crown (+3 INT)\n(Helm) Queen's Crescent Crown (+3 INT)\n(Helm) Witch's Glintstone Crown (+3 INT)\n(Helm) Twinsage Glintstone Crown (+6 INT)\n(Talisman) Marika's Scarseal (+3 INT)\n(Talisman) Marika's Soreseal (+5 INT)\n(Talisman) Stargazer Heirloom (+5 INT)\n(Great Rune) Godrick's Great Rune (+5 INT) - requires consuming a Rune Arc to activate the buff, after which it will last until death\n(Weapon) Grafted Blade Greatsword (+5 INT) - Using the special skill boosts all stats by 5. Using the skill requires 14 DEX and 40 STR (27 when 2-handed)\n(Flask of Wondrous Physick) Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear (+10 INT) - lasts for 3 minutes upon consuming the flask\n\nAfter casting the spell, revealing a plot-point, go back to Goldmask and tell him what you found out. \n\nAfter this, you can talk to Brother Corhyn, and he will offer to sell you the Immutable Shield incantation.\n\nAfter leaving them (reloading in the same place won't make them disappear), Goldmask and Corhyn will move to the bridge south of Stargazers' Ruins right above the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins Site of Grace. [Map Link] \n\nA dialogue option also appears to give Brother Corhyn the Tonic of Forgetfulness upon advancing his questline to Mountaintops of the Giants, near the Stargazers' Ruins. Corhyn will refuse the potion and the item will remain in the player's inventory, but it will change the final step in this questline.\n\nAfter completing Crumbling Farum Azula, Goldmask can be found in Leyndell, Ashen Capital, he moves to the bottom of the colosseum cliffs facing the west side of the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace.. He will give you the Mending Rune of Perfect Order. Reload the area to loot Goldmask's Set.\nCorhyn can then be found at one of the possible two locations: \n\nCorhyn location 1: It is advisable to check for him here first, as the game loads you into Leyndell, Ashen Capital after you finish the main boss fight at Crumbling Farum Azula. He will be near the base of the giant spiral spear. Speak with him to exhaust all dialogue and then, after reloading the area, you can find a Flail, Corhyn's Bell Bearing, and Corhyn's Robe where he was sitting. [Map Link]\nCorhyn location 2: If you offered Brother Corhyn the Tonic of Forgetfulness, he will remain at the bridge south of the Stargazers' Ruins where you last saw him. Talk to him; he'll be unaware of Goldmask's absence. Reload the area and then collect all three of the above items where he was.\n\nNote: If you don't complete the questline, you can find both Corhyn's Bell Bearing and Corhyn's Robe on a cliff west of the colosseum, in Leyndell, Ashen Capital.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Brother Corhyn\nIntroduction:\n\nOh, I see you've just arrived. Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth.I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers, and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men.By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace.\nYou do! Wonderful news. Most Tarnished are blind to it these days.You are something of a rare breed. Well, what do you say?Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?\n\nSubsequent Visits§:\n\nAh, you appear to be doing well. Very good.Well then, would you like to learn an incantation?\n[Giving any other prayerbook]That... is a work of heresy.Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.(sigh) Very well... I'll take it off your hands.\n[Giving the Golden Order Principia]This...is a volume of incantation.It's good to see your enthusiasm.Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands.\n[Leave] May the Golden Order shine through you.\n\nLeaving the Roundtable Hold:\n\nThere's something I should mention to you as well.I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold.Do you know of the noble Goldmask?Though he was a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between, he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace.And now, I hear he has come to the Lands between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order...I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research.\nAh, I've been waiting your return.I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all.As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask.We may not meet again for some time.If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now is the moment.\n\nAt the Altus Plateau:\n\nAh, look who we have here.How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold.I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually. And will happily pass it along to you. \n[About the noble Goldmask]I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask.I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree.The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall.Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude,how little it is I truly know...\n[Tell the noble Goldmaks's whereabouts]Do...do you sport with me!?From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself!Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by.Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays.And to you too. My sincerest thanks. \n\nBridge above Road of Iniquity Side Path:\n\nAh, we meet yet again.Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself,and taken my place by his side as you can see.Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before.Though we must do so quietly, such that we do not disturb the great master's cogitation.\n[About the noble Goldmask]The master is always deep in contemplation.While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger.And though I am yet to comprehend the daintiest morsel of his wisdom...I know that this, this is my life's calling.The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian.\n\n§At Leyndell, Royal Capital:\n\n[To Goldmask]Master! What ever is the matter?Please, I implore you continue!Continue your reflections, your rhythms!I must be the one to record them!What matters this issue of Radagon, really?The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!Why must these qualms come to you now?We were on the very cusp!\nOh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed.I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements.\nThe master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree.While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild.Until he simply ceased.Now the master is facing quite the puzzle.The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However...The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...Who exactly was Radagon?The master is stumped.His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.Curse my mediocre mind.The master only has me; and here I fail him.\n[After telling Goldmask the statue's secret]What on Earth did you do to the master?Well, not that I'm complaining.Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me.I haven't the words to thank you.So I'd like to pass this on to you instead.A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly.\n[After telling Goldmask the statue's secret]To think, that Radagon was Marika herself.Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger.How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder.Sadly, I cannot comprehend it myself.Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter?Well, either way, I can continue my documentation.In truth, it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not.I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose.\n\nAt Stargazers' Ruins Bridge:\n\nAh, nice to see you.I can't believe you've come all this way.\nI've been gripped by a terrifying thought.The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger...betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order.A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked.Oh, but how could this be?I dread to even entertain the possibility... but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master. Tell me, have I simply lost my head? Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order, why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?\nOh master, put my mind at ease. Dispel these fearsome thoughts. I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe.\n\n[Offering the Tonic of Forgetfulness]It will make me forget, you say?So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts...Ha... ha ha...Would that I could... Would that I could...\n[After completing Crumbling Farum Azula, if the Tonic was offered] Master... where did you go? I'm right here. Please, show me. Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus... Let me document the motions... Master... Master... Where did you go?\n\n At Leyndell, Ashen Capital (if the Tonic was NOT offered)\n\nOh, it's you. I've finally come to understand.The master was nothing more than a madman.Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own!Could there be a more pitiable comedy?Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes!Ha... ha ha ha...\n\nWhen attacked:\n\n(Warning) Ngh!What are you trying to achieve? Cease that!\n(Combat) You've done it now. Faith grants me strength, that I might endure. O Golden Order, shine through me.\n(On player kill) Please don't trouble us again.\n\nUpon defeat:\n\nO guidance...of grace... Why...can't I\n(With Goldmask) O master... To be ever at your side...\n\nElden Ring Brother Corhyn Notes & Trivia\nFAQ: What happens if you kill Corhyn Elden Ring?\n\nCorhyn can be accidentally killed or even found dead in some cases if players progress too far without interacting with him. Some players have even mistaken him for zombies due to his appearances in the environments he is found him. Attack him and he will use his Flail and Sacred Seal to Heal himself during combat.  If killed he drops Corhyn's Bell Bearing. Flail. Corhyn's Robe. Players have attempted to undo this action by going to the Church of Vows and seeking absolution, however this action does not resurect fall NPCs and can only absolve any hostile relationships with NPCs. Players have also reported finding him dead at his second location: north of Altus Highway Junction after meeting him at the Roundtable Hold. \nWith Corhyn dead, you may miss out on his merchant stock and a few Incantations as well as a few items related to a few parts of his questline that involves Goldmask. Progress through his questline and he will also offer to sell you the  Immutable Shield. \nA few players have attempted to progress through this questline without Corhyn and a few have been successful casting the Law of Regression, skipping Corhyn's interactions and going straight to Goldmask. It appears that as long as you follow the questline stees and do not require the hints he provides, then the quest can still progress. After casting the Law of Regression, the next step would be to look for Goldmask then Brother Corhyn. If Brother Crohyn is not around, the next steps will occur after the Capital of Ash event is triggered and you find  Goldmask at his final location. He can be found in Leyndell, Ashen Capital, he moves to the bottom of the colosseum cliffs facing the west side of the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace.. He will give you the Mending Rune of Perfect Order. Reload the area to loot Goldmask's Set.\n\nCorhyn Other Notes\n\nAfter meeting Brother Corhyn for the first time, you'll receive the Prayer Gesture.\nKilling this NPC doesn't mark you as a sinner.\nIf provoked, Corhyn wields a Flail and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast Heal and (insert other spells)\nIf you manage to burn the Erdtree before ever reaching the Altus Plateau, meaning Brother Corhyn never leaves the Roundtable Hold, he will die when the Roundtable erupts into flame.  \n\nYou can accomplish this by defeating Fia's Chosen within the Deeproot Depths, which unlocks a teleporter directly to the Capital. From there, you can access the Mountaintops of the Giants without passing through the Plateau proper.\n\nBrother Corhyn Image Gallery\n\n Brother Corhyn at Leyndell, Ashen Capital, at the end of his questline.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
