\n\n  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil \n\nLocation\nForlorn Hound Evergaol\n\nDrops\n1,900Bloodhound's Fang\n\nHP\n1,450\n\nStrong VS\n\nStandard  \n\nSlash  \n\nStrike\n\nWeak to \n\nLightning\n\nBloodhound Knight Darriwil is a Boss in Elden Ring. Darriwil can be found at the Forlorn Hound Evergaol in Limgrave when exploring the area. This is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, doing so drops a useful item, as well as Runes.\nDarriwil is also a part of Blaidd's questline. Speak to Blaidd first before this encounter to be able to use him as a Summon.\nThe Lesser Bloodhound Knight is the normal enemy form of this boss. Another Bloodhound Knight appears in the Bloodhound Knight fight.\n\n Darriwil is nothing but a traitor. And in need of a fitting end to his tale.\n- Blaidd\n\nElden Ring Bloodhound Knight Darriwil Boss\n\nFound in Forlorn Hound Evergaol [Map Link]\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Agheel Lake South\nMultiplayer is not allowed for this boss\nYou cannot summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: It is possible to get help from Blaidd for this fight if you progress Kalé's questline\n\nBloodhound Knight Darriwil Combat information\n\nHealth: 1,450 HP \nDefense: 103.9\nStance: 65\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\nDamage: Standard, Slash\nInflicts: Hemorrhage\nDrops 1,900, Bloodhound's Fang\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 0\n\nMagic: 0\nFire: 0\nLightning: -20\nHoly: 0\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nScarlet Rot: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nHemorrhage: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nFrostbite: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\n\nSleep: 229 / 271 / 369 / 659\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.

Darriwil is very aggressive and his dash move allows him to move quickly and unpredictably around the arena. Be prepared to dodge at any time, and only attack once or twice when you have the opportunity or you'll end up trading hits.\nKeep Your Guard Up: While you're still learning his moves, guard when you're not attacking so he doesn't dash in and surprise you with an unexpected attack. A Greatshield is particularly effective here, since most of his attacks will bounce off it and give you a chance to guard counter. Be aware though that he'll still build up Hemorrhage even if you perfectly block his attacks. Try to bait his attacks when your Hemorrhage buildup is low, block one or two attacks before attacking, then back away and try to dodge until your status bar clears.\nWatch For Sparks: Pay particular attention to Darriwil's Grinding Attack and Clawing Attack, where he scrapes his blade or claw along the ground to create sparks. Both of these take him some time to recover from, so after you've dodged or blocked the initial attack you'll have a chance to land a hit or two.\nLet It Bleed: When your Hemorrhage meter fills up, you'll take 100 damage plus 10% of your total health. But since this fight comes early in the game, that's not actually much more than a normal attack would deal. It may be worth simply taking the damage, especially if you're blocking the rest of his attacks, and focusing on killing Darriwil rather than saving yourself.\n\nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nDarriwil is particularly difficult for ranged players, since he tends to move so quickly and dodge so readily that it's hard to land most ranged spells or arrows.\nForm a Phalanx: Take advantage of Darriwil's aggression using Glintstone Phalanx which will slam into him approaches to attack. Summon the blades when you've got some distance, then when he gets close focus on not getting hit and let the magic do its work. Ash of War: Glintblade Phalanx may be an even better choice since it costs less FP and deals more Stance damage.\nFake Melee: Close-range spells like Carian Slicer or Catch Flame avoid the dodging issue entirely by only attacking him when he's close by. This will require carefully sequencing your dodges and attacks, though, to make sure you aren't just trading hits.\nJump and Shoot: If you're using a bow, avoid using slow skills like Mighty Shot since he's likely to dodge them. Instead, jump backwards when he approaches and fire an arrow while you're in the air to avoid his attacks and get in some damage.\n\nAttacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nBloodhound's Step\nTenses up, then dashes a short distance forward. This doesn't deal damage but can position him for a surprise attack.\nStart guarding when you see him disappear, or prepare to dodge a follow-up attack.\n\nSwipe\nJogs forward and swipes with his claw.\nRoll when he holds his claw out to the side.\n\nGalloping Slice\nRuns towards you on all fours, jumping forward and slicing in a circle.\nRoll to your right once you see the tip of his sword to the right of his head. This will position you near him when he's recovering and give you time to get an attack in.\n\nArc Slash\nSlices his sword in a wide counterclockwise arc.\nRoll backwards or block.\n\nDiagonal Slash\nHolds his sword behind him, then swings it clockwise diagonally up.\nRoll when sword's tip is fully behind his body.\n\nTwirling Slam\nDoes one quick clockwise slice, then slams his sword down in front of him.\nRoll backwards or block. You can get in a quick hit during the recovery period.\n\nRising Slash\nSlashes his sword up, emitting sparks.\nDodge once out and once in to dodge the common Falling Slash follow-up.\n\nFalling Slash\nSlashes his sword over his shoulder and down in front of him.\nDodge in and land a hit while he recovers.\n\nOverhead Slam\nHolds his sword behind him briefly, then slams it down in front.\nRoll left or right, then get in a hit while he recovers.\n\nJumping Slam\nJumps into the air, then slams his sword down to the ground.\nRoll once he's at the top of his jump, then get in an attack or two.\n\nSpiral Retreat\nSpins twice counterclockwise while hopping away from you.\nRoll forward to put pressure on him while he recovers. Only the initial sword swing can hurt you.\n\nBloodhound's Finesse\nSwings his sword and backflips away.\nRoll towards him to evade the attack or block with a shield.\n\nGrinding Attack\nCharges forward while dragging his sword against the ground, emitting sparks on his right, then raises it in a large vertical slice.\nRoll to your right when you see his claw pass in front of his face, then get in a couple hits while he's recovering.\n\nClawing Attack\nCharges forward while dragging his claw against the ground, emitting sparks on his left, then slashes it upwards followed by a final horizontal slash.\nRoll twice to either side, then get a couple hits while he's recovering.\n\n: Attack can be parried\nElden Ring Bloodhound Knight Darriwil Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nBloodhound Knights are said to serve for life, so Darriwil may have served Ranni or Rennala in the past, but may have abandoned them at some point. This would explain why Blaidd has a personal grudge against him.\nIf the Radahn Festival has been triggered, Blaidd will not be available as a summon.\nThis boss shows some resemblance to the Boreal Outrider Knights from Dark Souls 3. It's movement and looks suggest the creature is not fully humanoid but has instead transformed into something in between a four legged beast and a knight. It's attacks cause a Hemorrhage Status Effect which would suggest it uses a sharp edged blade forged to perfection. Although the beastly forms of the creature show a certain ongoing degenerative process, it still is very nimble and assassin-like. The temporary invisibility could also be caused by either inhuman speed or magic.\nMuch like the named Crucible Knights, Darriwil is likely named after certain geological eras. In this case, the Darriwillian period, the upper stage of the Ordovician.\n\nBloodhound Knight Darriwil Combo Chart \n\nImage Gallery for Bloodhound Knight Darriwil in Elden Ring\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
