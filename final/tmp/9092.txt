This is not limited to the Black Flame spell. Godslayer Incantations are the collection of spells that conjure black fire and can be considered when selecting spells for your Memory slots when keeping Black Flame in mind. The Best way to make sure you are optimizing your damage output with Black Flame is to create a complementing build around it. Items like the Godslayer's Seal scales primarily with Faith and Strength and specifically adds boosts to Godslayer Incantations.\nThose who want to specialize in these Incantations would benefit with a starting class of either Prophet, Confessor or Samurai. A Blackflame Apostle Build has been pre-made for players who want to optimize their Black Flame casting. This is recommended for players 50 and above and was designed to boost Bleed and Damage by pairing the spells and the Seal with any bleed weapon. Black Flame Blade has a very short cast time but very short duration. It does extra damage, and it's damage over time is based on the Max HP of the enemy, so it's more effective against high HP targets like Bosses and tough enemies, and is fantastic in Co Op where Bosses and enemies have even more HP. It also is good against enemies that can't Bleed.Black Flame is your ranged spell that does solid damage, and a bit of damage over time as well based on the Max HP of the target, so just like Black Flame Blade is good against high HP enemies. However, you'll use this on many enemies just to clear some out before engaging in melee combat. Catch Flame is great for enemies that are physical damage resistant, and is slightly cheaper than Black Flame. Use when you need fire damage up close.\n\n
