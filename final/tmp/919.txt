Guardian Golem is a towering construct that wields a large axe in Highroad Cave. This is an optional boss as players are not required to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring.\nGolem is the normal enemy form of this boss.\n\nOne of the many constructs found across the Lands Between. It wields a large halberd to attack, along with being able to breath fire on anything below it. \n\nElden Ring Guardian Golem Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss.\nClosest Site of Grace: Highroad Cave\nMultiplayer allowed for this boss\nYou can summon Spirit Ashes for this boss\n\nElden Ring Guardian Golem Location\nDeep within the Highroad Cave in the far north of Limgrave. [Map Link]\n\nGuardian Golem Combat information\n\nHealth: 5,974 HP\nDefense: 101.3\nPoise: 120\nParriable: No\nCan be poise broken, allowing for a critical hit\nDamage: Standard, Fire\nCritical hits deal massive damage to Guardian Golem\nDrops 1,700\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 0\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked.

A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.

Most of its attacks aim forward or just in front of its feet.\n\nMelee Users\nCharge and Crit: Two charged heavy attacks from most weapons are enough to stagger Guardian Golem. Once it falls to the ground, you have a chance a chance for a critical hit on its chest which will do a massive amount of damage. It's slow enough that you should be able to get in a charged attack after each successful evasion, so stay close to its ankles and roll through its melee attacks. Be careful of Pool of Fire, though, and run away when you see him lean towards the ground.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nAnkle Biter: Guardian Golem is slow and has limited ranged attacks, so you may have an easier time than a melee user. As soon as you enter the arena, immediately begin shooting at its ankles while trying to keep your distance. The golem will eventually topple, at which point you can either go for a critical hit with a melee weapon or just use the downtime to do as much damage as you can without fear of counterattacks.\n\nGuardian Golem Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nAxe Sweep\nSweeps its axe across the floor\n Roll in the opposite direction of the sweep\n\nAxe Stab\nStabs the hilt of the axe into the ground\nThis attack doesn't aim at the player, so stay behind its legs or across the arena and use the time to get some hits in\n\nHilt Sweep\nSweeps the hilt of the axe to one side of its legs. Used when you're beside it\nThis mostly goes to the side, so roll behind its legs to avoid it\n\nCleave\nRaises the axe behind its head and brings it down in front of it\nRun towards it when you see it pulling back and roll or jump to avoid the shockwave. This attack has a very long recovery so it's a good chance to get in a few hits\n\nKneeling Cleave\nPuts one hand on the ground and slams its axe down in front of it while kneeling\nRun in when you see it leaning down and you should be able to avoid the first hit, then attack its legs to avoid follow-up attacks\n\nMega Stab\nTakes a couple steps back, raises its axe high above its head, and stabs the hilt down in front of it. After a pause, pulls it out creating another shockwave\nRoll to avoid the first shockwave, get in a hit, and then jump the second one\n\nAxe Charge\nPuts the head of its axe on the ground and charges forward, then turns around and uses the axe to hurl stones at you\nRun or roll to avoid the initial charge, then roll towards the stones\n\nFire Burst\nBreathes a short burst of fire directly underneath its head\nThis is its least-threatening fire attack, and won't hit you if you're near its feet\n\nFire Jet\nLeans forward with its hands on the ground and breathes fire counterclockwise across the arena. Used when you're far away\nIf you have time, run past its head to avoid the fire entirely. Otherwise, run in the direction the fire is moving. The fire moves slowly enough that rolling through it is inadvisable\n\nPool of Fire\nLeans forward with its hands on the ground and breathes fire beneath it while it slowly steps backwards. Used when you're at its feet\nRun away until the fire is finished\n\n Guardian Golem Combo Chart\n\nGuardian Golem Image Gallery\n[screenshots and artwork go here]\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
