The Frenzied Flame Seal scales primarily with Faith and is a good Weapon for Frenzied Flame incantations.\n\nFormless sacred seal bestowed by the maiden of the Three Fingers.Enhances incantations of the frenzied flame.\nThis seal is the mark of the Lord of Frenzied Flame. Scales incantations using strength, dexterity, intelligence, and faith all together.\n\nWhere to Find Frenzied Flame Seal in Elden Ring\nThe Frenzied Flame Seal weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nReceived at the end of Hyetta's questline. [Elden Ring Map here]\n\nElden Ring Frenzied Flame Seal Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: No Skill. This armament has no skill. If the armament in the other hand has a skill, that skill will be used instead.\nThis weapon cannot be upgraded with Ashes of War\nFrenzied Flame Seal can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nBuffs Frenzied Flame Incantations by 20%. You can double this buff by equipping a second Frenzied Flame Seal in your other hand.\nThis is one of the few magic catalysts that scale with both Intelligence and Faith, making it useful for hybrid spellcaster builds.\nFrenzied Flame Seal's Incant Scaling scales with Strength, a trait only shared by the Clawmark Seal. This Seal's incant Scaling also scales with Dexterity, a trait unique to this seal.\nThis Seal’s Incant Scaling Soft Caps for Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Faith are 15/30/45, with Faith providing more points in Incant Scaling than any of the other stats.\nCauses Madness Buildup:  (55)\n\nOnly applies to physical attacks made with the seal, as non-Frenzied Flame incantations cast with this seal will not gain Madness buildup on impact.\nThe amount of Madness caused by Frenzied Flame Incantations is not affected by this seal.\n\nFrenzied Flame Incantations include Frenzied Burst, Howl of Shabriri, The Flame of Frenzy, and Unendurable Frenzy. \n\nInescapable Frenzy is not currently buffed by this seal due to the spell's unusual damage calculation. See its page for details.\n\nSell Value:   100\nIf you're trying to get this solely to use Flame Cleanse Me, Bestial Vitality, or whatever set buffs you're after for your build, try using the Golden Order Seal or the Erdtree Seal. Still weightless, and you can cast your buffs just fine, even without meeting the requirements.\nSince the Frenzied Flame Seal has no Faith requirement, a pure Int build with less than 10 Faith can benefit from this seal by being able to use incantations with only Intelligence requirement, such as Law of Causality and Law of Regression.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08 a bug that prevented the follow-up attack from occurring when the Black Sword Incantation was activated with a Sacred Seal in the left hand has been fixed.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below.\nWas known as the Spark of Frenzy in version 1.00.\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Frenzied Flame Seal\n\n Frenzied Acolyte Written Guide\n\nDeath Knight Written Guide\n\nMeteor Mage Written Guide\n\nHowling Starfist Written Guide\n\nMad King Written Guide\n\nGodslayer Written Guide\n\nFrenzied Flame Seal PvP Poise Damage Values in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations. Please take note that these adjustments are exclusive to PVP.\n\nOne-Handed Attacks\n\n1H R1 (1/2/3/4/5/6 Attacks): 54/54/108/--/--/--\n1H R2 (1/2 Attacks): --\n1H Charged R2 (1/2 Attacks): --\n1H R1 Jumping: 81\n1h R2 Jumping: 216\n\nTwo-Handed Attacks\n\n2H R1 (1/2/3/4/5/6 Attacks): 70.2/70.2/140.4/--/--/--\n2H R2 (1/2 Attacks): --\n2H Charged R2 (1/2 Attacks): --\n2H R1 Jumping: 105.3\n2h R2 Jumping: 237.6\n\nFrenzied Flame Seal Upgrades in Elden Ring\nPlease see the Upgrades page to understand the weapon bolstering process.\nRequires regular reinforcement with Somber Smithing Stones\nThis upgrade can't be enchanted with Magic or boosted with Consumables.
