CONTEXT
\nPlayer Trade for Elden Ring, also simply known as Trading, is an online mechanic where players can exchange various items and equipment between players. There may be limitations to which items and equipment can be traded. Guidelines, various mechanics and any other information regarding trading can be found on this page. Please note that this wiki page is made solely for that purpose. Leaving a comment on the page to have people help you with trading is discouraged, because of the implied risks. Try using the Official Discord link of the Fextralife Wiki and enter the Elden Ring channel instead.\n\nJoin the Wiki Trading Channel: https://discord.gg/mdjS3r53b8\nDo not install Apps or use websites that charge you to trade!\nDo not pay for trades, it will get you banned\n\nElden Ring Player Trade Guide\nItems and equipment that can be traded :\n\nWeapons (another player needs to own any weapon of same level or below in the inventory to see the drop)\nArmor\nRunes\nConsumables\nStarlight Shards\nCrafting materials\nAshes of war\nTalismans\n\nItems and equipment that cannot be traded :\n\nKey Items\nUpgrade Materials\nGreat Runes\nRemembrances\nRune Arcs\nSpirit Ashes\nCrystal Tears\nMagic Spells\n\nPlayer Trade Notes and Tips\n\nPlayers can leave a total of 8 items, when a 9th item is dropped the 1st despawns and so on.(A notification informs the player of the despawning but not always.
