It is an art that lies somewhere between tuning an instrument and conducting a conversation, leaving both parties enriched.\n\nGrave Glovewort [8] Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to find Grave Glovewort [8]:\n\nLeyndel Catacombs: A total of 4 can be found in this dungeon, which is accessed from below the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds.\n\nThe first is on top of the second coffin you'll see in a flooded room (there are three of these flooded coffin rooms in this dungeon), each on separate floors.\nThe second is in a "fake" boss room containing two Omen, on the second floor of the dungeon.\nThe third is on the path to the second floor's flame statue.\nThe fourth is on the third floor (accessible via a set of double stairs on the second floor), right before the room that resembles the ones containing flame statues on the first two floors (this one contains a Omen ambush, though).\n\nGiant-Conquering Hero's Grave: A total of 3 can be found in the dungeon. [Map Link] \n\nOne found in the large hall locked behind an Imp Statue barrier. This is directly above the flamethrower pillar and there is a hole in the ground where a section of the pillar can rise through.\nUpon reaching the lift, take it to the lower level and then step on the plate again to send it back up. When it's fully raised, you can find an opening in the lift column. Pull the lever in the nearby alcove and go inside the opening in the lift column to descend further down. At the bottom level, sprint past the Lesser Burial Watchdog and turn right to find the second glovewort behind a second Lesser Burial Watchdog.\nDirectly after picking up the second glovewort, climb the long ladder in the alcove to the right to reach an otherwise inaccessible area far west of the Troll hall. You can find the third glovewort on the north wall up here.\n\nGiants' Mountaintop Catacombs: A total of 3 can be found in the dungeon. [Map Link] \n\nDescend the first lift you find and then step on the plate again to send it back up. When fully raised, there is a second platform on the lift that will take you to the lowest levels of the catacombs. From here, continue east to a room with a set of stairs on the right and a Lesser Burial Watchdog. Check underneath the stairs for the first glovewort.\nContinue north from the first glovewort to a narrow corridor with a frost breath trap at the end. Turn left halfway through the corridor and pick up the second glovewort at the end of this path.\nGet back on the first lift and ascend back onto the main path. Head left from the Boss Doors and descend the dungeon's second lift. Turn right in the room with the statue and you will wind up in a hall with guillotine traps. Past the guillotines, turn left in the next corridor and go through the room with several Land Squirts. In the next hall, you will see a small room in the back with a Living Jar guarding it. Ignore that room and instead, look for an alcove on the left that you can drop down through. You will end up on a balcony overlooking a room with a statue that looks identical to the one you have previously passed but this is an entirely different floor. Head west from the statue and you will end up in another identical hall filled with guillotine traps, except this time, you can see another statue in a room in the distance. The final glovewort is found next to this statue.\n\nCan be purchased from Twin Maiden Husks at the Roundtable Hold after offering Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing (3)\nShunning Grounds Video Location\nShunning Grounds Video Location\n\nGrave Glovewort [8] Elden Ring Guide\n\nUsed in to strengthen GRAVE Spirit Ashes up to +8.
