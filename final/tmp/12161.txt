Unendurable Frenzy spell grants a violent burst of yellow flame of frenzy from eyes. Updated to Patch 1.07.\n\nIncantation originating from the maddening Three Fingers. Causes the yellow flame of frenzy to violently burst forth from the caster's eyes. Hold to continue channeling the flame. This incantation can be used while in motion. It is the maddening pain and unstoppable tears of those afflicted with the flame of frenzy brought into being. \n\nUnendurable Frenzy Location in Elden Ring\nUnendurable Frenzy can be found in the following location:\n\nYelough Anix Ruins: Found in a chest inside an underground treasure room in the central section of the ruins. [Elden Ring Interactive Map Link] \n\n In a four walled ruins on the western side. Reachable by double jumping with Torrent from the central building with the sleeping giant. \n\nElden Ring Unendurable Frenzy Guide\n\nFrenzied Flame Incantation\nStamina Cost: 40\nDeals fire damage\nInflicts Madness buildup (40) to opponents and (3) to self. \n\nNote that all but a handful of enemies in PVE are immune to Madness.\n\nContinuously shoots semi-random, upward arcing projectiles in an area in front of the caster, and can be continued until the user has no more FP.\nCerulean Hidden Tear can be used to cast this spell indefinitely for up to 15 seconds or until the Madness meter is filled completely, and Speckled Hardtear can be used to temporarily increase Madness resistance, further raising the casting duration.\nThe user has some resistance to stagger when using this spell, so it can trade hits with smaller enemies quite well.\nThe wide range of the attack makes it somewhat less effective against smaller, high health enemies. \n\nThis can be mitigated by free aiming the camera slightly lower than it would otherwise be aiming at a locked on target.  This will cause the projectiles to be fired straight into the target, rather than the normal upward arc.\n\nMadness damage continues to build if the spell is channeled for longer. \n\nThis limits is effectiveness when coupled with the Cerulean Crystal Tear and/or Cerulean Hidden Tear, since the spell will be interrupted if the madness meter is filled completely.\nThis also makes it the best item for inflicting Madness on the user, allowing one to trigger the Black Dumpling effect more reliably.  However, it takes a considerable FP investment, or low focus to trigger madness in a single use of the spell. The FP investment can be mitigated by using Cerulean Hidden Tear.\n\nIf madness is NOT triggered by this spell, when the spell ends (either voluntarily, or by consuming all available FP), it will trigger an additional attack, causing the user to throw their head back and shoot projectiles randomly in an area 360 degrees around the caster.  This additional attack is used even if the user has no FP. \n\nThis makes the spell useful as a crowd clearing tool even if you don't spend huge amounts of FP on it\nHowever, this makes the spell dangerous to use close to threatening enemies, since the additional attack cannot be interrupted, so you almost ensure that anything that survives the initial attack will be able to counter-attack.\n\nNote: FP cost significantly reduced for initial cast as of Patch 1.07, from 30 to 22. The FP cast for holding the spell once cast is unchanged however.\n\nMad King Written Guide\n\nElden Ring Unendurable Frenzy Notes and Tips\n\nUpdated to patch 1.07. See Patch Notes for details.\nIn the 1.00 version, Unendurable Frenzy was called Frenzied Firestorm. \n\nElden Ring Incantations\n\nAgheel's Flame  ♦  Ancient Dragons' Lightning Spear  ♦  Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike  ♦  Aspects of the Crucible: Breath  ♦  Aspects of the Crucible: Horns  ♦  Aspects of the Crucible: Tail  ♦  Barrier of Gold  ♦  Beast Claw  ♦  Bestial Constitution  ♦  Bestial Sling  ♦  Bestial Vitality  ♦  Black Blade  ♦  Black Flame  ♦  Black Flame's Protection  ♦  Black Flame Blade  ♦  Black Flame Ritual  ♦  Blessing's Boon  ♦  Blessing of the Erdtree  ♦  Bloodboon  ♦  Bloodflame Blade  ♦  Bloodflame Talons  ♦  Borealis's Mist  ♦  Burn O Flame!  ♦  Catch Flame  ♦  Cure Poison  ♦  Darkness  ♦  Death Lightning  ♦  Discus of Light  ♦  Divine Fortification  ♦  Dragonbolt Blessing  ♦  Dragonclaw  ♦  Dragonfire  ♦  Dragonice  ♦  Dragonmaw  ♦  Ekzykes's Decay  ♦  Elden Stars  ♦  Electrify Armament  ♦  Erdtree Heal  ♦  Fire's Deadly Sin  ♦  Flame Fall Upon Them  ♦  Flame Fortification  ♦  Flame of the Fell God  ♦  Flame Protect Me  ♦  Fortissax's Lightning Spear  ♦  Frenzied Burst  ♦  Frozen Lightning Spear  ♦  Giantsflame Take Thee  ♦  Glintstone Breath  ♦  Golden Lightning Fortification  ♦  Golden Vow (Spell)  ♦  Great Heal  ♦  Greyoll's Roar  ♦  Heal  ♦  Honed Bolt  ♦  Howl of Shabriri  ♦  Immutable Shield  ♦  Inescapable Frenzy  ♦  Lansseax's Glaive  ♦  Law of Causality  ♦  Law of Regression  ♦  Lightning Fortification  ♦  Lightning Spear  ♦  Lightning Strike  ♦  Litany of Proper Death  ♦  Lord's Aid  ♦  Lord's Divine Fortification  ♦  Lord's Heal  ♦  Magic Fortification  ♦  Magma Breath  ♦  Noble Presence  ♦  O Flame!  ♦  Order's Blade  ♦  Order Healing  ♦  Pest Threads  ♦  Placidusax's Ruin  ♦  Poison Armament  ♦  Poison Mist  ♦  Protection of the Erdtree  ♦  Radagon's Rings of Light  ♦  Rejection  ♦  Rotten Breath  ♦  Scarlet Aeonia  ♦  Scouring Black Flame  ♦  Shadow Bait  ♦  Smarag's Glintstone Breath  ♦  Stone of Gurranq  ♦  Surge O Flame!  ♦  Swarm of Flies  ♦  The Flame of Frenzy  ♦  Theodorix's Magma  ♦  Triple Rings of Light  ♦  Urgent Heal  ♦  Vyke's Dragonbolt  ♦  Whirl O Flame!  ♦  Wrath of Gold\n\n
