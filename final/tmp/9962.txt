CONTEXT
\nGreatbows are a type of Weapon in Elden Ring. Greatbows are ranged weapons that can be used to inflict damage on hostile characters from afar and with great potential to break guard. They grant no guard protection, encouraging users to maintain distance from advancing enemies. Greatbows do not share the ability to fire mid-jump with the other types of bows. Greatbows require Great Arrows as ammunition.\nGreatbows can not be greased, spell buffed, or given new affinities, and out of all the Greatbows, only the Greatbow can be modified with many different Ashes of War, allowing you to change their Skills and Damage Type. The rest have fixed Skills that cannot be changed.\n\n See also: Bows | Light Bows\nElden Ring Greatbows\n\nAll Weapons\n\nWeapons by Type   \n\nAxes\nBallistas\nBows\nClaws\nColossal Swords\nColossal Weapons\nCrossbows\nCurved Greatswords\nCurved Swords\nDaggers\nFists\nFlails\nGlintstone Staffs\nGreataxes\nGreatbows\nGreat Hammers\nGreat Spears\nGreatswords\nHalberds\nHammers\nHeavy Thrusting Swords\nKatanas\nLight Bows\nReapers\nSacred Seals\nSpears\nStraight Swords\nThrusting Swords\nTorches\nTwinblades\nWhips\n\nElden Ring Greatbows Base Values\n\nQuick Search of All Weapons\n\n Name \nPhy\nRange\nMag\nFire\nLigh\nHoly\nCritBoost\nStr\nDex\nInt\nFai\nArc\nWgt\nSkill\n\nGreatbow\n 125 - \n 50 \n  - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n  20 D \n 20 D \n - - \n - - \n - - \n10\n - (9 9) Through and Through \n\nGolem Greatbow\n 130 - \n 50 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 24 D \n 18 E \n - - \n - - \n - - \n14.5\n - (9 9) Through and Through \n\nErdtree Greatbow\n 60 - \n 50 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 65 - \n 100 - \n 20 E \n 14 E \n - - \n 14 D \n - - \n11.0\n - (9 9) Through and Through \n\nLion Greatbow\n 120 - \n 50 \n - - \n - - \n - -  \n - - \n 100 - \n 22 D \n 18 D \n - - \n - - \n - - \n9.5\n - (25 -) Radahn's Rain \n\nElden Ring Greatbows Max Standard Values\n\nQuick Search of All Weapons\n ​ \n\nName\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nCri\nSta\nStr\nDex\nInt\nFai\nArc\nAny\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nBst\nRst\nWgt\n\nErdtree Greatbow\n147\n-\n-\n-\n159\n100\n150\nD\nD\n-\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n11\n\nGolem Greatbow\n318\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n150\nC\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n14.5\n\nGreatbow\n306\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n150\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n10\n\nLion Greatbow\n294\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n150\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n9.5\n\n
