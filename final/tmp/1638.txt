For example if an absorption is 60. 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number= less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances:\n\nPoison: ??\nScarlet Rot: ??\nHemorrhage: ??\nFrostbite: ??\nDeath: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers is the buildup amount to trigger it. For example if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Fia's Champions Boss Guide\n\nFia's Champions Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nFia's Champions Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Fia's Champions:\n\nUse Ash Summons with grabs like Finlay, since all Champions are NPCs that can be grabbed. \nUse the spell with Area of Effect (like Agheel's Flame)\nBuild up resistance to Magic damage.\nBring Rejuvenating Boluses Item\nDuring 3rd wave, eliminate champions as soon as possible - Lionel is a serious threat on his own.\n\nMelee Users\nThe first two waves should be easy and you can take your time to defeat then without wasting any resources, the last wave is more intense and it may be advised to Summon a Spirit Ally during the third wave to get more room to fight against them. Try to align then so you always attack one at a time and be aware of the space, as the arena becomes much smaller when the invasion begins. Always focus on the most aggresive invader.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nIt's important not to waste too many resources in the first 2 waves, as the third wave will get more problematic with three enemies attacking you at once. These enemies generally dodge ranged attacks while getting closer to you. It's advised to focus al your damage to one invader at once, until they are defeated and then attack the next one. Because 3 attackers may not leave too much room to attack or move between attacks. Try to spread them apart. \n\nFia's Champions Attacks & Counters\n\nAttacker\nDescription\nCounter\n\nFia's Champion\nAlmost every champion is a melee fighter, and you can identify their fighting style by looking at their gear. They all generally dodge magical ranged attacks. \nTheir range, their speed and timing can be easily measured by identifying their weapon and gear. Be aware of your space and avoid getting cornered as they move straight forward at you. \n\nSorcerer Rogier\n Rogier uses his signature rapier, with the Glintblade Phalanx skill. His spells include Magic Downpour, Glintstone Pebble, and Scholar’s Armament. He tends to either rush you or stay back and cast spells. \nEngage against him with heavy attacks, stunning and staggering him. You can defeat him before he's able to cast his first spell.\n\nLionel the Lionhearted\nLionel wields the Great Èpèe, along with a staff used to cast Rancorcall, summoning five homing skulls, and Fia’s Mist, creating a pestilent mist that builds up Death Blight.\nIt's not wise to engage against Lionel first, but you have to always be aware of him. Interrupt your own combos against other enemies to get safe from Lionel's attack if necesary. Focus first on the most aggresive Invaders dodging and avoid Lionel, and then focus on Lionel last.\n\nFia's Champions Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nSome of these Invaders are met previously throughout the game as friendly NPCs, Rogier and Lionel. The randomized champions are likely the many players that were hugged by Fia, or those who possess a Radiant Baldachin’s Blessing in their inventory.\nJust like Mimic Tear, Fia's champion is a boss that can die not from player direct hit (f.e by using Bloody Slash Ash of War)\n\nFia's Champions Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
