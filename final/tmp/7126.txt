CONTEXT
\n\n Shabriri \n\nLocation\nMountaintops of the Giants\n\nRole\nNPC and Summonable Cooperator\n\nVoiced by\nShaun Dooley\n\nShabriri is an NPC in Elden Ring. Shabriri can be found at the Mountaintops of the Giants and looks exactly the same as Bloody Finger Hunter Yura, as he implies the hunter died and he has been given his body. Shabriri can become available as an NPC Summon against Godfrey, First Elden Lord depending on questline progress and ending route. \n\nMay chaos take the world! May chaos take the world!\n\nShabriri Location in Elden Ring\nShabriri can be found at Mountaintops of the Giants, near the starting area location. Map Link\n\nThis NPC does not move\nThis NPC can be fought. Shabriri will use frenzy incantations to defend himself.\nIf defeated, drops the Ronin's Set\nNPC Summon: Godfrey, First Elden Lord. \n\nYou must have met with the Three Fingers at the Frenzied Flame Proscription to make him available.\nShabriri becomes unavailable if you proceed to use Miquella's Needle to remove the influence of the Frenzied Flame.\n\nShabriri Questline: How to complete Shabriri's Quest\n\nShabriri appears next to the Zamor Ruins site of grace when you arrive. He claims that Yura died and gave him this body.\nShabriri gives you directions for obtaining the Lord of the Frenzied Flame ending. You must meet with the Three Fingers by finding them near the Cathedral of the Forsaken below the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. You must remove your clothes in order to open the door and proceed. See Endings for more information. \n\nNote: Meeting with the Three Fingers will lock you out of all other ending choices, unless Miquella's Needle is used at Dragonlord Placidusax's arena at Crumbling Farum Azula. This removes the Frenzied Flame, and is a permanent reversal. \nIn order to summon him as a NPC Summon Cooperator against Godfrey, players must embrace the Frenzied Flame, which will also affect your ending. \n\nAfter you meet with the Three Fingers, Shabriri will disappear, and the Ronin's Set will be left in his place. You can also kill Shabriri for the set as soon as you meet him.\n\nShabriri Notes and Tips\n\nIf player meets with the Three Fingers before reaching where Shabriri is, he will not be found. The Ronin's Set will be on the floor in his place.\nHe wields Yura’s Nagakiba and uses Frenzied Flame Incantations.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Shabriri\n\n§\nIntroduction 初対面\n\nFinally, we meet. \n\nThe Tarnished who would be Lord. \n\nOh my, why the long face?\n\n I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel. \n\nWell, that is most unfortunate. \n\nFor he is dead. \n\nAs for his flesh, \n\nhe gave it to me, \n\nShabriri. \n\nI hope you can make your peace with that.\n\nWhen attacked\n\nWhat's this? Well, this is peculiar. This, I did not expect. But if you do not care for Lordship, I'm afraid you are of no use.\n(On player kill) How very unfortunate. I did not take you for a fraud.\n\nWhen killed\n\nShabriri is chaos incarnate. I cannot die. Ahh, may chaos take the world!\n\n§Visit\n\nYou are about to sacrifice something precious. The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge. Only so that you may be Lord. What a horrible thing to ponder. Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not. But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?\n\nChosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor. Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead. If you are prepared to show resolve and attain Lordship through righteous hardship, then heed the words of I, Shabriri.\n\nChosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord. Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital. Seek audience with the Three Fingers and the flame of frenzy. If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling and the girl can be spared ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship. The path of the Lord of Chaos. Burn the Erdtree to the ground, and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes. Ahhh, may chaos take the world! May chaos take the world!\n\nElden Ring Shabriri Notes & Trivia\n\nCan be summoned as a cooperator for the Godfrey, First Elden Lord boss fight.\nShabriri is the name of a Demon of Blindness in Jewish mythology, which is hinted at here due to the hands suggestively covering his eyes. In modern Hebrew, Shabriri translates literally as "fragile".\nHe is referenced in the talisman Shabriri's Woe, as a man who had his eyes gouged out, and had the frenzied flame inhabit his sockets, which may explain why he covers his face. \n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
