CONTEXT
\n\n Roundtable Knight Vyke \n\nLocation\nLord Contender's Evergaol,Mountaintops of the Giants \n\n Drops\n Fingerprint SetVyke's Dragonbolt Runes 75000 \n\n Strong VSPhysical-type Fire Immune toMost Status Effects \n Weak to Lightning \n\nRoundtable Knight Vyke, also known as Vyke, Knight of the Roundtable is a Boss in Elden Ring. Vyke is a Tarnished warrior from the past wielding a spear and using Dragon Cult Incantations. This is an optional boss as players don't have to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring, but will be rewarded with useful items and Runes for doing so.\n For the Invader variation of this boss near Church of Inhibition, see Festering Fingerprint Vyke.\n\n No other Tarnished was closer to the throne of the Elden Lord than Vyke. But without announcement, Vyke traveled far below the capital, and was scorched by the flame of frenzy.\nDid he make his choice for his maiden, or did some other force lure him with suggestion?\n\nElden Ring Roundtable Knight Vyke Boss\nContender's Evergaol, just east of the Whiteridge Road site of grace in the Mountaintops of the Giants region. Map Link\n\nOptional boss\nField Boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Whiteridge Road Map Link\n\nThere is Stake of Marika near boss fight arena\n\nMultiplayer is not allowed for this fight\nYou can not summon Spirit ashes for this boss\n\nRoundtable Knight Vyke Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG+ (??), NG++ (??), NG+3 (??), NG+4 (??), NG+5 (??), NG+6 (??), NG+7 (??)\nPoise: ???\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being parried\nDamage: Standard, Pierce, Lightning \nLike many enemy NPCs, he can heal only once.\n\nAbsorptions:\n\nStandard: 40\nSlash: 40\nStrike: 40\nPierce: 40\nMagic: 20\nFire: 40\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 20\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example if an absorption is 60.40% of that damage bythat type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage.An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 meanthe enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances:\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\nDeath Blight: immune\n\nThe resistance numbers is the buildup amount to trigger it. For example if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nVyke, Knight of the Roundtable Boss Guide\n\nRoundtable Knight Vyke Boss Video Guide\n\nRoundtable Knight Vyke Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Vyke:\n\nHis weapon buff also lowers his Lightning Defense by around 35%, so use any weapons that deal Lightning Damage\nSuggested spells: For faith, Lightning Spear, Lightning Fortification, and Flame of Frenzy.For intelligence, Stars of Ruin, Night Comet, Gavel of Haima.\nSuggested items: Boltdrake Talisman  and Lightningproof Dried Liver for lightning defense, Boiled Crab and Pickled Turtle Neck  for defense and stamina recovery.\n\nMelee Users\nOne main thing to note when facing Vyke is that he mainly uses lightning attacks, but is also weak to lightning. You can come prepared with a few options: Boltdrake Talisman will have the ability to boost Lightning Damage negation while the Lightning Scorpion Charm raises Lightning Damage, but lowers damage negation. With neither of those items on hand, there is a consumable that would also temporarily boost lightning negation. Lightningproof Dried Liver can easily be Crafted or found from a few locations in Leyndell Royal Capital and Altus Plateau. Users also recommend a Faith Lightning Spear since his buff makes him vulnerable to lightning and he can be easily staggered due to his low poise. \nWhen facing Vyke, watch for his leaping attacks and Fortissax’s Lightning Spear. He uses a few other Lightning attacks that can only be used when he buffed himself with the Lightning buff. Without it, he will be forced to use his melee attacks with his spear. There will be a short period as he buffs himself that would give players an opening to strike. This is animated by him raising his spear and a bolt of lightning strikes him, giving him his power. Be aware of these openings and quickly back away as the action ends because he will immediately follow up with a few of his lightning attacks. This will give you space to avoid them. \nWhen his lightning attacks end, he may sometimes run towards you to close the distance which will give you an opportunity to reposition or even charge at him. Most of his melee actions are quick with a short range so you can easily roll back away from them and follow up with an attack as well. If you happen to have a shield and are too close to avoid his charge attack, you can instead, guard counter this action. Continue with a combination of avoiding his lightning strikes, rolling back away from his melee attacks then charging forward in between attacks to eventually clear his HP.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nWhen you prepare to face him, be aware that his main attacks and weaknesses are both to lightning. You may equip the relevant talismans to boost lightning negation or damage such as the Boltdrake Talisman which will have the ability to boost Lightning Damage negation or the Lightning Scorpion Charm which raises Lightning Damage but lowers damage negation. Lightningproof Dried Liver will also be able to boost lightning negation. \nWith magic, you can use the large arena to your advantage. In the Evergaol, circle around him and continuously use your ranged attacks such as Rock Sling since he staggers easily. Night Comet is also said to be effective against him and his quick dodges. It can also be used to interrupt his heals. Avoid attempting to afflict any Status Effects on him since he is immune. He will begin with a set of melee attacks until you see his charge-up animation which opens him up to use his lightning attacks. Create some distance and he will be forced to give chase in order to deal his melee charge attacks. During this time, you can attempt to deal more attacks from a distance while continuously repositioning yourself to deplete his HP.\n\nRoundtable Knight Vyke Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nMelee combo\nVyke attacks with his weapon, either with running attack or regular melee combo\nBack away or parry\n\nStorm Assault\nVyke creates a gust of wind around him and shortly after he leaps into the air and plunges into ground dealing massive damage. \nHe has hyper-armor during that attack, so the best solution is to run away. A good moment to prepare a heavy attack. This attack has slight AOE.\n\nLightning Strike\nVyke calls down several lightning strikes on the player's location.\nIf you see yellow sparks on the ground, dodge to the sides immediately.\n\nVyke’s Dragonbolt\nVyke casts a buff, that grants 15% increased Equip Load and buffs his weapon to inflict Lightning Damage. \nUse Lightning-type weapon, as it reduces Lightning Damage negation by 35%\n\n Fortissax's Lightning Spear\nVyke jumps up and slams down two lightning spears, creating lightning waves that travel outward.\nBack away as far as you can. After the second spear explodes, perform a jumping attack.\n\nVyke, Knight of the Roundtable Notes & Trivia\n\nWields special variant of Vyke's War Spear with Storm Assault Ash of War and a sacred seal (likely Gravel Stone Seal) \n\nIt lacks Fire Damage comparing to other variation of this spear.\nThis special variant of Vyke's War Spear also shares the same strong attack as the Lance and Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear\n\nDefeating this variant does NOT prevent the invader from appearing.\nVyke appears on Elden Ring's cover art, kneeling down and holding a sword.\nIn 1.00 version, in Evergaol there was a current Festering Fingerprint Vyke named Vyke the Dragonspear\n\nVyke, Knight of the Roundtable Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
