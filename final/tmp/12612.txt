CONTEXT
\nIncantations are a type of Magic in Elden Ring. Incantation spells are typically dependent on the Faith stat, and have a variety of effects (such as healing, curing status effects, dealing damage, and enchanting people or weapons). Incantations are cast using Sacred Seals. Incantations in Elden Ring are a combination of what would be Miracles and Pyromancies from past Souls games. You will find familiar favorites, as well as new ones. \n\nIncantations Trainers\nMost Incantations can be acquired from different NPCs that act as trainers and sell you Incantation spells. Here is a list with all Incantation trainers in Elden Ring:\n\nBrother Corhyn can be found at Roundtable Hold, then he moves next to a road in Altus Plateau, after which he proceeds to the broken bridge (also in Altus), and finally he relocates to Leyndell.\nD, Hunter of the Dead initially stands near Summonwater Village, and later he sits at the table in Roundtable Hold.\nGurranq, Beast Clergyman can be found at the Bestial Sanctum in northeastern Caelid. This location can be accessed by using a waygate in Limgrave. [Map link]\nMiriel, Pastor of Vows is inside the Church of Vows, in eastern Liurnia of the Lakes.\nGowry\n\nOf these trainers, a select few have the ability to learn from prayerbooks and grant access to new Incantations:\n\nMiriel, Pastor of Vows, who is a highly recommended choice, because he does not move from his position at the Church of Vows, and you may give him both Incantation prayerbooks and Sorcery scrolls. \nBrother Corhyn.\n\nLegendary Incantation Spells in Elden Ring\nTo unlock the Legendary Sorceries and Incantations Trophy and Achievement, you will need to acquire the following incantations:\n\nFlame of the Fell God\nGreyoll's Roar\nElden Stars\n\nSorceries\n\nIncantations\n\nElden Ring Incantations\nIncantation Prayerbooks\n\n Name \n Unlocks \n Location \n\n Two Fingers' Prayerbook \n\nLord's Heal\nLord's Aid\n\nFortified Manor, First Floor: in the Leyndell Royal Capital.\n\n Assassin's Prayerbook \n\nAssassin's Approach\nDarkness\n\nCan be found behind the second Imp Statue door in Roundtable Hold.

In general, Incantation spells are typically dependent on the Faith stat, and have a variety of effects. View all Incantations and each of their stat requirements and effects above. To get started with any type of Magic or Incantation, you will need to make sure you first meet all the stat requirements which would be some combination of Intelligence, Faith and Arcane. This is also beneficial to you at higher levels of these stats since these spells will also scale with your stat levels increasing their effectiveness or damage against opponents in combat. You will also need to have a Sacred Seal, which are equipment pieces specifically for casting Incantations. You will need one with you in order to be able to cast the spell. One of the Classes, the Prophet, will already have one as part of their starting equipment set. There are a number of Sacred Seals to choose from and each will have a set of stats and passive effects or boosts that can further improve your build. \n\nMemorize Spell\n\nObtain your desired spell or incantation then you can start Memorizing Spells from your inventory. The first step is to rest at a Site of Grace where you will have a few additional options besides resting at this spot. Choose to Memorize Spell to bring up a menu with your Sorceries and Incantations. From here this will also display your current Memory Slots, Empty Slots and FP. The Slots at the top display your Memory Slots. Select one of the slots then choose which spell you will like to equip into that memory slot. Make sure that you meet the requirements and conditions for the Spells you select to memorize. You may now see these equipped spells from the quick access menu and switch your items here with the designated button depending on the platform you play on. Once selected, attack to use the spell. You may need to press and hold down your attack button until the action successfully activates. This will then successfully deploy the spell and drain some of your FP.\n\nMemory Slots\n\nYou will start off with only 2 Memory Slots so you will also need to increase your Memory Slots with Memory Stones, which are obtained from different Locations throughout the game. View all known locations here. \n\nIncantations Other Notes\n\nIncantations Other Notes and Tips go here\n\n

QUESTION
Why are Incantations in Elden Ring typically dependent on the Faith stat?

ANSWER
Incantations in Elden Ring are typically dependent on the Faith stat because Faith is the stat that these spells scale with and also have a Faith requirement to use them effectively.
