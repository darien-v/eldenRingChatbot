CONTEXT
\nShields in Elden Ring are pieces of protective equipment which provide defense against the world's Enemies and Bosses. Typically wielded in the off-hand, Shields are capable of guarding, parrying, bashing, or even something entirely unique with their respective Ashes of War. They can be two-handed for increased stability against incoming attacks. Most Builds can benefit from having a Shield equipped, even with infrequent use.\nPlease visit Shields Comparison Table for a minimalistic view with Max Upgrade stats.\n\nSuggested Early Game Shields\nSome useful aspects to look out for in selecting an early game shield are:\n\nModest stat requirements to wield\nEase of acquiring\nDecent Guard Boost (How much stamina is used per block)\n100 Physical Damage Reduction (Anything less than 100% would only be useful in specific builds.)\n\nSome candidates:\n\nBeast Crest Heater Shield: \n\n100% physical negation, 51 Guard Boost, 10 Str required, 3.5 weight\nLooted from a chest in a camp northeast Limgrave, past the Warmaster's Shack\nVery light for a Medium Shield, has low requirements, while still having 100% physical negation and decent Guard Boost. An ideal earlygame selection for many characters.\nGood variety of other heater shields with virtually the same requirements later on for fashion.\n\nBrass Shield: \n\n100% physical negation and decent elemental defense, 56 Guard Boost, 16 Str required, 7.0 weight\nEasily farmed from Soldiers all across the game.\nHas the best Guard Boost among Medium Shields, but is also the heaviest and requires significant Strength investment.\n\nGreat Turtle Shell: \n\nComes with the Barricade Shield skill that temporarily enhances Guard Boost and lets your shield deflect more attacks before running out of Stamina.\nPassive stamina regeneration bonus (+8%) while in use. This passive remains active if you're two-handing your main weapon.\n87% physical negation, 49 Guard Boost, 14 Str required, 5.5 weight\nObtained at the top of a tower accessed by Spiritspring Jump near the Castle Morne Rampart Site of Grace in the Weeping Peninsula.\nFormerly a popular choice before its physical negation was reduced in v1.03.\n\nCarian Knight's Shield:\n\n100% physical negation, 71% magic negation, 49 Guard Boost, 10 Str/10 Dex/15 Int required, 4.5 Weight.\nDropped by defeating Moongrum, Carian Knight near the boss room of Raya Lucaria Academy.\nExcellent damage negation against both physical and magic attacks, but requires Intelligence investment and defeat of a midboss.\n\nBuckler: \n\nComes with the Buckler Parry skill with faster startup and generous parry frames.\nPoor damage negations and Guard Boost. 8 Str/13 Dex required, 1.5 weight\nStarting equipment for Bandits. Otherwise bought from Gatekeeper Gostoc at Stormveil Castle.\nFor those who prefer to parry rather than block.\nCan be substituted by putting Ash of War: Golden Parry or Ash of War: Carian Retaliation on any small or medium shield.\n\nWhen selecting a Shield players need to factor in many things including; Requirements, Weight, Guard Boost, and the Damage Reductions of the Shield.\n\nRequirements: What stats are needed to use the shield effectively.\nWeight: How much the shield weighs, which affects your Equip Load.\nGuard Boost: The higher the Guard Boost, the less Stamina that's consumed for each attack you block. Upgrading shields increases their Guard Boost every other level (+3, +5, and so on).\nType: While a shield's Guard Boost determines how much stamina is consumed when you block, the shield's Type (small, medium, or great) determines which attacks will bounce off of it, briefly stunning the attacker in a recoil animation (a perfect opportunity for a guard counter). Greatshields will bounce the most attacks, while small shields will only bounce very light attacks. For example, Brass Shield has a higher guard boost than Wooden Greatshield but will not bounce any attacks from a Banished Knight, while the Wooden Greatshield will bounce most normal attacks from the same enemy.\nDamage Reduction: How much of each damage type will be prevented when you block an attack with the shield. Physical damage reduction applies to Standard, Strike, Slash, and Pierce damage. For example, if a shield with 59% Fire Damage reduction blocks an attack that would normally deal 132 Fire Damage, you'll only take 54 damage.\nDamage: To attack with a shield, two-hand it or equip it to your right hand. Unless you're doing this, a shield's damage stats are irrelevant.\nSpecial Skill: Infusing Ash of War: No Skill onto your shield lets you continue to use the shield to block attacks without losing access to your main weapon's skill.\n\nAll Shields\n\nSmall Shields\n\nMedium Shields\n\nGreatshields\n\nElden Ring Shields List\n\nSmall Shields\nSmall Shields are a type of Shield that usually weigh very little and have the least form of protection from attacks. They are often used by players who prefer Parrying rather than Blocking.\n\nRickety Shield\n\nRiveted Wooden Shield\n\nBlue-White Wooden Shield\n\nScripture Wooden Shield\n\nRed Thorn Roundshield\n\nPillory Shield\n\nBuckler\n\nIron Roundshield\n\nGilded Iron Shield\n\nMan-Serpent's Shield\n\nIce Crest Shield\n\nRift Shield\n\nPerfumer's Shield\n\nShield of the Guilty\n\nSpiralhorn Shield\n\nSmoldering Shield\n\nCoil Shield\n\nMedium Shields\nMedium Shields usually have better stability and damage reduction than small shields, but at the price of increased weight.\n\nHawk Crest Wooden Shield\n\nHorse Crest Wooden Shield\n\nCandletree Wooden Shield\n\nFlame Crest Wooden Shield\n\nMarred Wooden Shield\n\nSun Realm Shield\n\nRound Shield\n\nLarge Leather Shield\n\nBlack Leather Shield\n\nMarred Leather Shield\n\nHeater Shield\n\nBlue Crest Heater Shield\n\nRed Crest Heater Shield\n\nBeast Crest Heater Shield\n\nInverted Hawk Heater Shield\n\nEclipse Crest Heater Shield\n\nKite Shield\n\nBlue-Gold Kite Shield\n\nScorpion Kite Shield\n\nTwinbird Kite Shield\n\nBrass Shield\n\nBanished Knight's Shield\n\nAlbinauric Shield\n\nBeastman's Jar-Shield\n\nCarian Knight's Shield\n\nSilver Mirrorshield\n\nGreat Turtle Shell\n\nGreatshields\nGreatshields boast the greatest guarded damage negation and blocking stability but suffer from significant carry weight.\n\nWooden Greatshield\n\nLordsworn's Shield\n\nBriar Greatshield\n\nSpiked Palisade Shield\n\nIcon Shield\n\nGolden Beast Crest Shield\n\nManor Towershield\n\nCrossed-Tree Towershield\n\nInverted Hawk Towershield\n\nDragon Towershield\n\nDistinguished Greatshield\n\nGilded Greatshield\n\nCuckoo Greatshield\n\nRedmane Greatshield\n\nGolden Greatshield\n\nHaligtree Crest Greatshield\n\nCrucible Hornshield\n\nDragonclaw Shield\n\nFingerprint Stone Shield\n\nEclipse Crest Greatshield\n\nAnt's Skull Plate\n\nErdtree Greatshield\n\nJellyfish Shield\n\nVisage Shield\n\nOne-Eyed Shield\n\n
