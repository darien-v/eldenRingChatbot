The Staff of Loss will boost the damage of 2 Night Sorceries: Night Comet and Night Shard. The projectile sorceries - Ambush Shard, Night Comet, and Night Shard - cannot be “seen” by enemy NPCs and thus will not attempt to dodge them like they would for their Glintstone counterparts.\n\nAberrant\n\nCarian\n\nClaymen\n\nCold\n\nCrystalian\n\nDeath\n\nFull Moon\n\nGlintstone\n\nGravity\n\nLoretta's\n\nMagma\n\nNight\n\nPrimeval\n\nNight Sorceries info\n\nObtaining Night Sorceries\n\nGowry can sell Night Shard and Night Maiden's Mist, after completing \nThere aren't Scrolls available for Night Sorceries.\nCheck the Night Sorceries individual pages to learn their location.\n\nNight Sorceries Requirements\n\nAs is the case with all Sorceries, you must have a Glintstone Staff equipped in order to be able to cast Night Sorceries.\nNight Sorceries require Intelligence to use.\n\nBoosting Night Sorceries\n\nStaff of Loss can boost Night Shard and Night Comet, as well as Unseen Blade and Unseen Form, but the buff has no effect on them as they do not do damage.\nAzur's Glintstone Staff reduces the casting time of all Sorceries, but increases the amount of FP consumed.\n\nAll Night Sorceries\n\nAmbush Shard\n\nEternal Darkness\n\nNight Comet\n\nNight Maiden's Mist\n\nNight Shard\n\nUnseen Blade\n\nUnseen Form\n\n
