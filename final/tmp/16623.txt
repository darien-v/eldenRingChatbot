The Erdtree Greatbow scales primarily with Faith and is a good Weapon for ranged combat.\n\nGreatbow featuring Erdtree styling. In times of old, when faith and battle went hand in hand, this weapon was created in tandem with the Golden Great Arrow.\nScales all arrow damage with faith, revealing its true worth when used with holy-infused arrows.\n\nWhere to Find Erdtree Greatbow in Elden Ring\nThe Erdtree Greatbow weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nKilling the chariot in Fringefolk Hero's Grave (requires two Stonesword Keys to access.).\nFollow the path to where you get the Erdtree's Favor talisman, but walk off the edge before you reach the bridge, there is a platform there, then jump off again. You'll find some stairs that lead to an elevator, take the elevator up. Be careful of the dragon knight shade on the far left. once he's dealt with, go to where he was, and look to the right, there are 3 large pots suspended by 3 ropes on the ceiling. In order to get the bow, you have to kill the chariot by dropping one of the pots on it as it rolls by. I used the longbow, and timed it by 1 Mississippi after it makes contact with the wall closest to you.
