[Map Link]\nNecromancer Garris Combat information\n\nHealth: 3,202 HP \nPoise: 3\nParryable: No\nDamage: Strike, Magic\nDrops 9,000, Family Heads\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 9.9\nSlash: 8.9\nStrike: 8.9\nPierce: 5.6\n\nMagic: 20.1\nFire: 18.8\nLightning: -0.8\nHoly: 20.1\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 174\nScarlet Rot: 174\nHemorrhage: 148\nFrostbite: 148\n\nSleep: 229\nMadness: 229\nDeath Blight: 226\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n3,202\n4,150\n4,565\n4,772\n4,980\n5,395\n5,602\n5,810\n\nRunes\n9,000\n2,700\n29,700\n30,375\n32,400\n33,075\n33,750\n34,425\n\n Defenses \n\nPhysical\n100\n118\n121\n124\n130\n136\n142\n154\n\nMagic\n131\n155\n157\n159\n162\n164\n166\n169\n\nFire\n117\n138\n140\n142\n145\n147\n149\n151\n\nLightning\n95\n112\n114\n116\n117\n119\n121\n122\n\nHoly\n100\n118\n120\n122\n124\n125\n127\n129\n\nElden Ring Necromancer Garris Boss Guide\n\nNecromancer Garris Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nNecromancer Garris Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Necromancer Garris:\n\nUse strike weapons to quickly dispatch the skeletal snails, which can roll at you at fairly high speed and make the fight more difficult.\nThe trickiest part about this encounter are the Skull Snail Summons that also have the ability to cast death magic (summon the homing skulls)\n\nMelee Users\nThis fight is reasonably straightforward for melee users, who will be able to take down Garris' small health pool quickly. Focusing on slash weapons will help speed the encounter as Garris can bleed. The fight has only two major dangers. First, Garris is able to do damage very quickly with his flail, which also causes bleed buildup. Staggering mid-combo will help avoid this, but his AI acts like an NPC invader so expect Garris to roll to avoid being stunlocked and counterattack. If the player has their poise broken, Garris will move in for a counterattack and can deal significant damage this way. Second, the Skeletal Snails spawn in regularly throughout the match, apparently dropping from the ceiling, without input from Garris. These serpents will also attack with death magic, and while not individually dangerous the spam they add to the room can break a players rhythm and create an opening for Garris. Typically it is best to finish the fight quickly to avoid spam buildup. \nMagic and Ranged Users\nBe aware of the arena since it is an enclose space, you may need to reposition to keep clear of getting stuck if focused on ranged weapons especially with a lot of things going on in the arena for this encounter. During this fight, remember to focus on clearing the Skeletal Snails that are summon because like Garris they can cast the death magic homing skulls which act as his main ranged attack.  Other than that, his moveset isn't so quick so you just have to keep the arena from being surrounded. If having a difficult tie with this, use a tanky summon to take the load off of other things in the arena. If possible use quicker casting spells to potentially interrupt his home skull spell cast. \n\nNecromancer Garris Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nFlail Melee\nHe deals a series of regular melee attacks that don't have a large range and can be followed with a dodge roll away. \nThese actions can be interrupted and blocked. It is recommended that you stay close to follow up with a series of your own attack. \n\nHoming Skulls (Death Magic)\nHas the ability to cast a hoard of skulls that have a slow homing feature  \nIf you can back away from these and avoid them long enough, they eventually disappear. This action also has the opportunity to be interrupted and cancelled. \n\nSkeletal Snail Summon \nThese creature summons can roll around and even roll lunge towards you, and can cast their own homing skulls as well a do a small melee lunge.\nThey are easy to clear or keep a distance from, but don't put off clearing them because Garris can summon more and each of them can cast a homing skull. \n\nNecromancer Garris Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: ??\nAccording to the description of the Rancorcall spell, Garris was the person who unearthed and rediscovered the spell.\nThe three copper heads of his flail were made to resemble his wife and two children.\nHe wields the Prince of Death's Staff, a staff embedded with sullied amber, which was said to be a part of Godwyn, the Prince of Death. The staff was deemed heretical by the academy for being able to be augmented through faith in addition to intelligence. He also wears the Sage Set, an outfit worn by wise sages that were deemed heretical and driven from towns.\nOther Notes and Trivia Go Here\n\nNecromancer Garris Image Gallery\n[screenshots and artwork go here]\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
