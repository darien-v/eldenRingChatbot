The Pulley Crossbow does not scale with any stat attributes, but requires Strength and Dexterity. It is a good Weapon for those users who prefer to fight their battles from afar. The Pulley Crossbow fires three bolts with one press of the trigger, with a slight spread between bolts.\n\nCrossbow made with pulleys and power springs. The complex mechanism, which required advanced mathematical and mechanical understanding to craft, was likely made by a certain genius who learned Golden Order fundamentalism. \nOne touch fires a volley of bolts. Be warned; large stores of bolts can be quickly spent.\n\nWhere to Find Pulley Crossbow in Elden Ring\nThe Pulley Crossbow weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nFound next to the Site of Grace at the Craftsman's Shack. [Map Link]\n\nElden Ring Pulley Crossbow Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Kick\nThis weapon fires its bolts with an unusually large upward pitch (tilt). When aiming at mid-range, players should aim lower than usual, aiming at humanoid enemies' chests to land headshots. Leveling Dexterity has been shown to mitigate this effect significantly. \nDue to the this weapon's reliance on multiplicity of shots over a single, powerful shot, landing headshots against low-pose creatures, especially those upright (humanoids etc.), it is often extremely difficult to land all the weapon's shots against the enemy's head, due to their flinch and hurt animations\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nThis weapon cannot be enchanted with Magic or boosted with Consumables\nSell Value:   100\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below.\nDue to a bug, when used 1-handed in offhand, this weapon applies any elemental/status buff (spell buff, weapon skill buff, grease) from mainhand weapon (Fixed in Patch 1.05).\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Pulley Crossbow\n\nVideos for the Pulley Crossbow Coming Soon\n\nPulley Crossbow Upgrades in Elden Ring\nPlease see the Upgrades page to understand the weapon bolstering process.\nStrengthened using Somber Smithing Stones.\n\nAttack Power\nStat Scaling\nPassive Effects\nDamage Reduction (%)\n\nPulley Crossbow\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nSta\nStr\nDex\nInt\nFai\nArc\nAny\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nBst\nRst\n\nStandard\n65\n-\n-\n-\n-\n30\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +1\n73\n-\n-\n-\n-\n33\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +2\n81\n-\n-\n-\n-\n36\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +3\n89\n-\n-\n-\n-\n39\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +4\n97\n-\n-\n-\n-\n42\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +5\n105\n-\n-\n-\n-\n45\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +6\n113\n-\n-\n-\n-\n48\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +7\n121\n-\n-\n-\n-\n51\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +8\n130\n-\n-\n-\n-\n54\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +9\n138\n-\n-\n-\n-\n57\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +10\n146\n-\n-\n-\n-\n60\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nElden Ring Crossbows\n\nArbalest  ♦  Crepus's Black-Key Crossbow  ♦  Full Moon Crossbow  ♦  Heavy Crossbow  ♦  Light Crossbow  ♦  Soldier's Crossbow\n\n
