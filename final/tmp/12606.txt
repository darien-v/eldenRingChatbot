The Sword of St Trina scales primarily with Intelligence, Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for its Unique Skill Mists of Slumber that releases a faint purple mist that spreads across a wide frontwards area. This mist inflicts the sleep ailment upon foes. Using the skill also coats your weapon for 30 seconds with an effect that appears similar to using a Soporific Grease, increasing the sword's base Sleep buildup from 66 to 136.\n\nSilver sword carried by clerics of St. Trina. Inflicts sleep ailment upon foes. St. Trina is an enigmatic figure. Some say she is a comely young girl, others are sure he is a boy. The only certainty is that their appearance was as sudden as their disappearance. \n\nWhere to Find Sword of St Trina in Elden Ring\nThe Sword of St Trina weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nIn the Forsaken Ruins, near the Rotview Balcony Site of Grace, behind an Imp Seal requiring one Stonesword Key. [Map Coordinates]\nThis weapon is very easy to get at a very low-level as a sorcerer. With just 18 int, rock sling, and ideally the meteorite staff, you can stand on the balcony near the site of grace and attack the crows. The first hit will knock them to the ground, and then you can just fling rocks at them until they die and they will be completely unable to attack you since they can't reach you. Once you've killed the two that matter, you can go down the cliff on the left and get to the area very easily and safely.\n\nElden Ring Sword of St Trina Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Mists of Slumber\nPatch 1.06 fixed a bug in which the Soporific Coating would disappear upon taking damage.
