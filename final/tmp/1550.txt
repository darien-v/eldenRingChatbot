These humanoid enemies dress in an armor made from voluminous flaps of skin, wielding rapiers and black flame magic. They are optional bosses as they don't need to be defeated to advance in Elden Ring.\nGodskin Noble also appears in the Godskin Duo fight and as a spirit summon in a Spirit-Caller Snail fight.\n\n Nobles are the most ancient apostles who are said to have assimilated inhuman physiology. Not unlike the crucible, the Erdtree in its primordial form.\n\nElden Ring Godskin Noble Location\nGodskin Noble can be found in various locations:\n\nVolcano Manor [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nDivine Tower of Liurnia  [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nGodskin Noble Combat information\n\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nDamage: Standard, Pierce, Fire\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 0\nSlash: -10\nStrike: 35\nPierce: 0\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 40\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Godskin Noble Boss Guide\n\nGodskin Noble Boss Video Guide\n\nGodskin Noble Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Godskin Noble:\n\nUse sleep pots to put the boss to sleep. Usually one is enough and will allow you to get multiple hits in before it wakes up. Repeat as needed.\nAlternatively, sleep arrows are very easy to craft at the point of game when players meet Noble for first time.\n\nMelee Users\nThe Godskin Noble is fast and can deal damage or break poise rapidly through the Stab and Overhead Strike, and Stab and Backhand attacks. Generally melee users should circle around the Noble to deal damage while avoiding combo attacks, and quickly back away when the Black Flame Barrier spell is telegraphed. Parrying is difficult and not necessarily critical given the Noble does not have significant resistances to physical attack. Simply dodge rolling and avoiding physical attacks while striking occasionally is generally enough to outlast the Noble.\nBleed, poison and rot may be applied to the Noble without significant difficulty but take care when doing so with short or midrange melee weapons as the Noble does use its shove, barrier, stomp and belly roll moves to distance the player character if too much damage is done at once. The belly roll may be stopped by striking the Noble during the roll which will interrupt the attack and provide an opening for followup attacks.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nStrategy Writeup for Magic Users\nBridge to Divine Tower of Liurnia: Once reaching his threshold that causes his attack pattern to change, the Godskin Noble will roll at the player. When he begins rolling, you can catch him in one of the ports on the side of the bridge so he gets stuck. If you're able to make it back to the entrance, you can go to one side and when he attempts to roll up the stairs he will angle over the guard rail and fall to his death.\nFor Incantation users, best is to inflict one of Status Effects at the start and then attack Noble with either Lightning Spear or Swarm of Flies.\n\nGodskin Noble Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nBlack Flame\nThe Noble raises his left hand behind him and conjures a ball of Black Flame which he then tosses at his target.  tosses towards his target. The projectile has a rather fast travel speed and deals damage over time for a couple of seconds after a direct hit.\nWatch the telegraph and dodge sideways or through the projectile as soon as he tosses it. The Noble's Black Flame has a slower cast compared to the Apostle.\n\nBlack Flame Ritual\nThe Noble holds his left hand low and to the side and then conjures pillars of black flame all around him. The flames persist for a while after, preventing melee attacks until they dissipate.\nDodge away as he lowers his hand and maintain your distance.\n\nDouble Stomp\nThe Noble fiercely stomps with his right leg twice in front of him. Deals damage in a small radius around the point of impact.\nMaintain distance, dodge backwards if caught in melee range, or parry.\n\nBelly Shove\nThe Noble shoves his target with his large belly. Does not deal damage, but can stagger targets.\nDodge backwards.\n\nStab & Overhead Strike\nThe Noble performs a quick jab with his rapier and then follows up with a slow overhead slash.\nDodge both attacks sideways. It may be easier to just block the stab and then dodge the overhead slash.\n\nStab & Backhand\nThe Noble stabs with his rapier and then performs a backhanded slap with his left hand.\nDodge the stab by rolling to his right and the backhand should not hit you.\n\nBelow 60% Threshold\nWhen the Noble is brought down to 60% HP, he will cross his arms and float upwards and then slam down, releasing a shockwave in a small radius around him. This signifies the start of Phase 2 where he "unseats" the skin on his abdomen, allowing him to significantly bloat his belly, giving him a much larger hitbox for certain attacks. He also gains new attacks.\n\nGodskin Wheel\nThe Noble bloats up his belly and leaps up, landing on his side and then rolls around like a wheel, trampling anything in his path.\nSprint to the side as soon as you see his belly increase in size. Hide behind pillars until he's done rolling.\n\nGodskin Crusher\nThe Noble bloats his body and floats upwards, before slamming down.\nDodge in once you see him begin to descend. If you get knocked down by the initial blast, you can dodge in safely as soon as you get up.\n\nRepeating Thrust\nHolds its rapier upright before unleashing a fast combo of thrusts.\nDodge to his side and punish.\n\nNoble Presence\nThe Noble quickly thrusts his belly forward, dealing moderate damage and stunning targets in front of it.\nThis attack is extremely fast, coming out in only 13 frames, but does not deal too much damage. There is a faint audio cue that’s similar to the casting sound of Black Flame and Black Flame Ritual but dampened. Dodge to his side.\n\nGodskin Noble Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nAlong with their Apostle comrades, they served the Gloam-Eyed Queen and wielded Black Flame to slay gods and carve their skin to wear for themselves. Theories suggest that the Gloam-Eyed Queen is Melina\nOne met at Divine Tower of Liurnia can be baited to roll himself of the bridge and die.\n\n Godskin Noble  Volcano Manor  \n\nDrops\n50,000Serpent's AmnionGodskin StitcherNoble Presence\n\nHP\n10,060\n\nElden Ring Godskin Noble Boss (Volcano Manor)\n\nThis is an optional boss, although either it or Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood must be defeated to proceed in Volcano Manor\nClosest Site of Grace: Prison Town Church\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nGodskin Noble Location\nFrom the Guest Hall Site of Grace, head east across the lava and up the rooftops until you reach a stone platform with a cage elevator.
