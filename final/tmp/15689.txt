The Starscourge Greatsword scales primarily with Intelligence, Strength, and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for pulling in enemies using its unique skill, Starcaller Cry. The Starscourge Greatsword is one of a few non-Claw/Fist Paired Weapons.\n\nCurved greatswords of black steel wielded by General Radahn. A pair of weapons decorated with a lion mane motif.\nRadahn earned considerable renown as the Starscourge in his youth, and it is said that it was during this time he engraved the gravity crest upon these blades. \n\nWhere to Find Starscourge Greatsword in Elden Ring\nThe Starscourge Greatsword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nTrade Remembrance of the Starscourge with Enia at Roundtable Hold.\n\nElden Ring Starscourge Greatsword Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Starcaller Cry\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nCannot be enchanted with Magic nor boosted by Consumables\nStarscourge Greatsword can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nDeals +30% damage to  Gravity type enemies\nUsing the usual input to two-hand these weapons will instead result in dual-wielding both swords akin to how Radahn wields them. Note that despite the fact that they are dual-wielded rather than two-handed, the weapon still receives the two-handed strength bonus for non-paired attacks and can be properly wielded below strength requirement when two-handing despite the game showing otherwise. Paired attacks do not receive the two-handed strength bonus.\nHeavy attacks, and heavy charge attacks will not swing both swords, making these attacks overall less effective than using light attacks or light jump attacks.\nStarcaller Cry will stagger and pull in enemies in the first cast. Utilizing the Weapon Skill again after the initial pull will spend FP again, equal to the first cast, bringing down both swords into the ground and produce a giant gravity explosion.\n\nIt is recommended to use it in situations with packs of enemies to gain the most value out of this skill.\n\nStarcaller Cry's initial damage dealing AOE counts as a roar-type attack and thus benefits from the effects of the Roar Medallion and Highland Axe passive.\nSell Value:   1000.\nNote: As of Patch 1.08, the Speed of Crouching and Rolling Attack has been slightly increased.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
