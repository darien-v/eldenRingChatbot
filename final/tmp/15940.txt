The Ripple Crescent Halberd scales solely with Arcane and is a good Weapon for any Arcane build with its decent range and flexible moveset, and is great for Arcane casters in need of a buffable weapon.\n\nWeapon wielded by young Albinaurics.\nThe blade is said to resemble a partial image of a ripple, and its attack power scales with one's arcane attribute.\n\nWhere to Find Ripple Crescent Halberd in Elden Ring\nThe Ripple Crescent Halberd weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nHas a low chance to drop from Albinaurics that wields it, found in Academy Gate Town\n\nA group of three Albinaurics who wield this weapon can be found at the first ruin to the east of the Fallen Ruins of the Lake Site of Grace in Liurnia [Map Link] \n\nTwo Albinaurics can be found sitting at the southern end of the ruin. One can be found standing on top of the ruin.\n\nDrops fairly quickly near the Palace Approach Ledge-Road grace. Just past the shoreline, there is a tree with half a dozen or so enemies carrying this halberd.\n\nElden Ring Ripple Crescent Halberd Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Spinning Slash\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War, but can be buffed with Magic and Consumables.\nThis is one of few arcane scaling weapons that can be buffed, as arcane scaling increases status-effect buildup as well as damage, this is ideal for a melee arcane build that uses a lot of greases.\n\nGrease Statistics\n\nKeep in mind that the only greases that scale with Arcane are: Blood Greases, Poison Greases, and Soporific Greases\nStatus Grease Build-Up with +25 Ripple Crescent Halberd and 45 Arcane: \n\nPoison Grease - 177\nDrawstring Poison Grease - 225\nBlood Grease - 84\nDrawstring Blood Grease - 107\nSoporific Grease - 93\nDrawstring Soporific Grease - 118\n\nStatus Grease Build-Up with +25 Ripple Crescent Halberd and 60 Arcane: \n\nPoison Grease - 200\nDrawstring Poison Grease - 254\nBlood Grease - 94\nDrawstring Blood Grease - 121\nSoporific Grease - 105\nDrawstring Soporific Grease - 133\n\nStatus Grease Build-Up with +25 Ripple Crescent Halberd and 80 Arcane: \n\nPoison Grease - 208\nDrawstring Poison Grease - 264\nBlood Grease - 99\nDrawstring Blood Grease - 125\nSoporific Grease - 109\nDrawstring Soporific Grease - 139\n\nThe Ripple Crescent Halberd has less Status Grease Build-Up the its axe counterpart, The Ripple Blade. However, the Ripple Crescent Halberd has significantly longer reach and an inherently superior moveset due to being a halberd. Also, in PvP, the extra Status Build-Up the Ripple Blade has over the Ripple Crescent Halberd is purely overkill since both weapons already proc Poison and Sleep in just two hits using their respective Drawstring Grease.\n\nSpell buffs like Bloodflame blade don't appear to scale properly on this weapon, however.\nRipple Crescent Halberd can be upgraded by using Smithing Stones.\nSell Value:   100\nBase drop rate is 2% (at 100 Discovery)\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
