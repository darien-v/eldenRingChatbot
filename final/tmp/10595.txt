CONTEXT
\nEndings for Elden Ring cover the possible conclusions of the game, determined by the player and their influence on The Lands Between's denizens. Each ending is shaped by the player's interactions with certain NPCs and their respective Side Quests. This page covers each ending, the requirements to reach an ending, and frequently asked questions. There are a total of six (6) possible endings in Elden Ring.\nSee the Lore page for a deeper dive into the history of The Lands Between and its inhabitants.\n\nCan I See Multiple Endings in a Single Playthrough?\nTraditionally, no; each playthrough can only have a single ending, and another can only be seen after completing your next playthrough in New Game+. However, it is possible to make use of save states at the end of your first playthrough to complete an ending and then load to a previous state and complete another. This is an effective way to unlock all ending-related Achievements or to see multiple endings without completing another full playthrough. So far, this method is possible on Steam, PS4/PS5, and Xbox One/Series. \nWith the exception of one ending that will explained below, you can work towards and complete all the relevant quests required for each ending without being locked to it. After beating the final boss, you can choose which ending you want to go for out of the endings you've unlocked.\n\nElden Ring Endings Helpful Links:\n\nCheck New Game+ to find out what happens for your next playthrough.\nCheck our Walkthrough page for detailed on how to clear each Location.\nYou may also visit the Game Progress Route page for a quick overview of how to progress through the game.\nVisit Side Quests to find how to complete ending-related NPC questlines.\nSee Secrets for other notes and tips.\n\nHow To Prevent the Chaos Ending\nThis question suggests that you have met with the Three Fingers to inherit the Frenzied Flame. To reverse this, you will need Miquella's Needle which can be obtained after completing Millicent's questline and returning the Unalloyed Gold Needle to the Scarlet Aeonia left after Malenia, Blade of Miquella's fight. Miquella's Needle can be used at Dragonlord Placidusax's arena in the Crumbling Farum Azula to reverse the Three Fingers' flame of frenzy. Fighting Placidusax is not necessary to use the needle; simply being in the boss arena will do.\n\nElden Ring Endings Guide: How to get All Endings in Elden Ring\nOverall summary\n\nThere is a total of 6 endings. The player will become the Elden Lord except in the "Lord of Frenzied Flame" ending and the "Age of Stars" ending.\nAny of the four Elden Lord endings grants the Trophy/Achievement, meaning you only need to clear the game 3 times to get all of them, and not 6.\nThere is no clear good, bad, or true ending due to the ambiguity of the fate of the Lands Between after the player character mends the Elden Ring in most endings.\n\nElden Ring Endings Explained\n\nAge of Fracture ♦ \n\nAge of the Duskborn ♦ \n\nAge of Order ♦ \n\nBlessing of Despair ♦ \n\nLord of Frenzied Flame ♦ \n\nAge of the Stars\n\nAge of Fracture Ending (Elden Lord)\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nMust not inherit the Frenzied Flame when touching Fractured Marika.\n\nHow to obtain ending:\n\nAfter the final boss, touch Fractured Marika and choose to "Mend the Elden Ring" to get the Age of Fracture Ending.\n\nEnding Description:\nThe Age of Fracture ending is the default ending of the game, where the Tarnished chooses to mend the Elden Ring as it is and begin the new age as Elden Lord.\n\n"The fallen leaves tell a storyOf how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.An Age of Fracture."\n\nAge of the Duskborn Ending (Elden Lord)\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nComplete Fia's questline to receive the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince\nMust not inherit the Frenzied Flame when touching Fractured Marika.\n\nHow to obtain ending:\n\nAfter the final boss, touch Fractured Marika and choose to "Use Mending Rune of the Death-Prince" to get the Age of the Duskborn Ending.\n\nEnding Description:\nAfter using the Cursemark of Death on Godwyn's corpse to give him a second life as the First of the Dead, Fia lays with him and bears the first of Dead demigods - in the form of a rune. In the Age of the Duskborn Ending, the Tarnished chooses to use this Mending Rune of the Death-Prince to begin a new age of Duskborn as Elden Lord - where the Lands Between are engulfed in a harrowing fog and the principle of life within Death is embedded into Order, ridding the world of immortality and allowing the natural cycle of life and death to occur for all people and creatures alike.\n\n"The fallen leaves tell a storyOf how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.The Age of the Duskborn."\n\nAge of Order Ending (Elden Lord)\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nComplete Goldmask and Brother Corhyn's questline to receive the Mending Rune of Perfect Order.\nMust not inherit the Frenzied Flame when touching Fractured Marika.\n\nHow to obtain ending:\n\nAfter the final boss, touch Fractured Marika and choose to "Use Mending Rune of Perfect Order" to get the Age of Order Ending.\n\nEnding Description:\nThe Age of Order Ending is an alternative version of the Golden Order ending, where the Tarnished chooses to use the Mending Rune of Perfect Order on the Elden Ring to restore order to the Lands Between by putting an end to all the strife caused by forces "emboldened by the flames of ambition".\nThe noble Goldmask once lamented that "all the good and the great wanted, in their foolishness, is an absolute evil to contend with", implying that one who seeks greater power to further his or her ambition will, in all likelihood, presents himself or herself as the greater good and condemn the other side as the absolute evil. Each will accuse the other as committing heresy. Strife would ensue, plunging the Lands Between into chaos and unending conflicts.\nThe Age of Order thus envisions a new age of stability, where there is no more conflict brought upon by the "fickleness of the gods no better than men" which was "emboldened by the flames of ambition".\n\n"The fallen leaves tell a storyOf how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.The Age of Order."\n\nBlessing of Despair Ending (Elden Lord)\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nComplete Dung Eater's quest and give him Seedbed Curses until you receive the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse.\nMust not inherit the Frenzied Flame when touching Fractured Marika.\n\nHow to obtain ending:\n\nAfter the final boss, touch Fractured Marika and choose to "Use Mending Rune of the Fell Curse" to get the Blessing of Despair Ending.\n\nEnding Description:\nThe Blessing of Despair Ending is an alternative version of default ending of the game, where the Tarnished chooses to use the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse and begin the new age as Elden Lord - the difference being, now, the Lands Between has now been overtaken by a reviled curse. While the details of what the curse brings isn't fully explained, it is the same curse brought from Dung Eater's defilement, causing defiled souls to be unable to return to the Erdtree. With the fell curse embedded in the Elden Ring, all present and future generations will be afflicted with this loathsome curse.\n\n"The fallen leaves tell a storyOf how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.The reviled curse that defined our age.The Blessing of Despair."\n\nLord of the Frenzied Flame Ending\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nMeet with the Three Fingers to inherit the Frenzied Flame. \n\nMeeting with the Three Fingers will lock you out of all other ending choices, unless Miquella's Needle is used at Dragonlord Placidusax's arena at Crumbling Farum Azula. This removes the Frenzied Flame, and is a permanent reversal.\n\nHow to obtain ending:\n\nAfter the final boss, touch Fractured Marika and choose to "Become the Lord of Frenzied Flame" to get the Lord of the Frenzied Flane Ending.\n\nEnding Description:\nIn the Lord of the Frenzied Flame Ending, the Tarnished goes down a different path to become the Lord of Frenzied Flame. If the Frenzied Flame is inherited before the events at the Forge of the Giants, Melina leaves the Tarnished's company, leaving the Tarnished to sacrifice their own body at the Forge. This leads to an extra scene at the ending, showing Melina without the mark on her left eye, devoting herself to deliver "Destined Death" to you.\nIf the player obtains the Frenzied Flame after the events at the Forge, the scene with Melina does not occur, due to her own prior sacrifice.\nAs explained by the Three Fingers through Hyetta at the end of her quest, this ending sees the Tarnished take up the mantle of the Lord of Chaos, and tasked with burning the world, along with the mistakes of the Greater Will - all existing sin, torment, fracture, and curse - to unite everything and everyone much like the crucible which existed before time.\n\n"Lord of Frenzied Flame...I will seek you, as far as you may travel...To deliver you what is yours,Destined Death"- Melina\n\nAge of the Stars Ending\nEnding Requirements and Conditions:\n\nComplete the questline of Ranni the Witch.\nThe Frenzied Flame must not be inherited or must be quelled, otherwise Ranni's summon sign will not be visible. \n\nIf the Frenzied Flame was inherited, it can be quelled by using Miquella's Needle.\n\nHow to obtain ending:\n\nAfter defeating the final boss, use Ranni's summon sign to initiate the Age of the Stars Ending.\n\nEnding Description:\nIn the Age of the Stars Ending, after defeating the Elden Beast, instead of mending the Elden Ring, the Tarnished summons Ranni the Witch in front of Marika's remains. Ranni supplants Marika as Goddess and takes The Tarnished as her Elden Lord.She brings an end to The Golden Order, establishing an Order of her own (not named but likely similar to the Order of the Dark Moon, which we currently know little about). In doing so she also removes the influence of The Greater Will from The Lands Between. She leaves The Lands Between together with The Tarnished and takes her Order with her, on a journey meant to last a thousand years.  As a result of her absence, The Lands Between is left without a lord for the first time in an age.\n\nIn her final cutscene she states the following:"...The battle is over, I see.I do solemnly swear. To every living being, and every living soul.Now cometh the age of the stars.A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon.Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.Into fear, doubt, and loneliness...As the path stretcheth into darkness.Well then. Shall we? My dear consort, eternal."\nOnce her questline has been fully cleared, it is possible to go back to her room and talk with her doll, where she further explains her plans with the following dialog:“Upon the order I envision.Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet.As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove.And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch…All become impossibilities.Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order.Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only lord?”\nThe original Japanese script makes the sentence "And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch… All become impossibilities." more clear, as it does not refer to denying sentient creatures of all emotions, but instead to removing the Order she is creating from their reach. As described in a Frontline Gaming Japan article[1], the following is the literal translation:生命と魂が、律と共にあるとしても、それは遥かに遠くにあればよい “…Even if life and souls are one with the order, it (the order) could be kept far away.”\n確かに見ることも、感じることも、信じることも、触れることも …すべて、できない方がよい “If it was not possible to clearly see, feel, believe in, or touch the order… That would be better.”\nShe initially planned to go alone, living in solitude for 1000 years. This is suggested by the description of her Dark Moon Ring:"Whoever thou mayest be, take not the ring from this place, the solitude beyond the night is better mine alone."\n\n[1] Elden Ring: Ranni’s Age of Stars ending mistranslations explained (https://www.frontlinejp.net/2022/03/14/elden-ring-the-age-of-stars-ending-mistranslations-explained)\n\n

QUESTION
Why is it important to prevent the Chaos Ending in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Preventing the Chaos Ending in Elden Ring is crucial because it leads to an irreversible path of becoming the Lord of Frenzied Flame, resulting in burning the world and uniting everything in an endless cycle of sin, torment, and curse, contrary to the other endings that offer options for a more balanced and stable future for The Lands Between.
