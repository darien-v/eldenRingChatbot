CONTEXT
\nIn Elden Ring, Armor are protective items worn by the player's character which grant protections, resistances, and various bonus effects against damage and status effects, as well as influencing statistics such as carry load and poise. In Elden Ring, armor is divided into categories such as Helms, Chest Armor, Gauntlets, and Leg Armor. Players can adorn a full set of the same armor, or wear different pieces from different sets, with no additional buff if all pieces are from the same set. This means that the player can freely customise their armor to their needs without worrying about set bonuses.\nMany Armor pieces have Special Effects. See Equipment with Special Effects for a list of items with unique properties that affect your stats or performance.\nArmor is allowed in Player Trade online.\n\nAll Armor Sets in Elden Ring\nArmor Sets are complete combinations of individual Armor in Elden Ring. Armor Sets provides players with protection and resistances against all types of damage such as Magic, Fire, Light or Holy. Wearing Armor also changes the character's appearance. Wearing all Set pieces won't grant any additional effects.\nThere are exactly 559 pieces of armor in Elden Ring's base game. Unobtainable items (some listed here) include: Tarnished Wrap, Twinned Greaves (Altered), Ragged Set, Brave's Set, Grass Hair Ornament, Deathbed Smalls, and Millicent's Set. If you happen to come upon a cheater online and they hack these items into your save, remove them from your inventory immediately.\n New!
