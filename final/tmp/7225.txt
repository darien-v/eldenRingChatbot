The Jellyfish Shield is a Shield that scales with Strength. Greatshields weigh a lot, but provide the best protection in the game. Greatshields provide a greater value of blocking and protecting one's self from enemy and boss attacks, but greatly increases the weight and reduces the player's mobility. This type of shield works best at reducing damage or guarding instead of parrying.\nContagious Fury lasts for 30 seconds and increases damage by 20%. However if you then two-hand the weapon the buff from jellyfish shield is removed. \n\nThe head of a spirit jellyfish, commonly found floating above sacred ground throughout the Lands Between, wielded without modification as a shield.The see-through head is extremely light, but its flesh is supple, providing absolutely no protection from piercing attacks.\n\nAlthough the text says that "It provides absolutely no protection from piercing attacks", being a 100% physical shield, it seems to block piercing attacks.\nWhere to Find Elden Ring Jellyfish Shield\nThe Jellyfish Shield Shield can be found at the following location:\n\nOn a broken wagon next to a corpse surrounded by four Jellyfish, directly north of the Foot of the Four Belfries Site of Grace.

Of course, you can't use any weapons while holding two jellyfish shields but it does boost the damage of consumables if you want to be cheeky and kill a boss with throwing knives.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below. \n\nBug: Can two-hand any weapon and keep the Contagious Fury buff active. Can also switch out the shield for anything else in the left-hand and retain the buff.)\n\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09.1, the above bug has been fixed.\n\nBattlemage Written Guide\n\nDragon Kinght Written Guide\n\nCrystal Mage Written Guide\n\nLightning Lancer Written Guide\n\nThundering Sword Spear Written Guide\n\nFreezing Battlemage Written Guide\n\nMagic Dragonknight Written Guide\n\nInquisitor Written Guide\n\nDragonscale Daimyo Written Guide\n\nCarian Cleaver Written Guide\n\nJellyfish Shield PvP Poise Damage Values in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations.
