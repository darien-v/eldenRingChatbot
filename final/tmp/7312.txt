CONTEXT
\nAshes of War in Elden Ring are special items that allow you to grant your armaments (Weapons and Shields) new Skills and Affinities. They're integral for creating Builds and adapting to the many Enemies and Bosses of The Lands Between.\n\nClick here to scroll down to the Ash of War List ↓\nCheck Upgrades to learn more about upgrading and modifying your equipment.\nAshes of War are allowed in Player Trade online.\n\nHow to Use Ashes of War in Elden Ring\nWith a Whetstone Knife, you can use Ashes of War to grant your armaments new Skills and Affinities at Sites of Grace. Alternatively, players may visit Smithing Master Hewg at the Roundtable Hold who offers the same services.\nAn armament can only have one skill; any skills it previously had will be removed.\nAn armament's type determines which skills or affinities it can have. Details on which armaments an ash of war is for can be found in its item description.\nSome special armaments have unique skills and cannot be granted new ones. \nAshes of War can be repeatedly used without a cost, unlike similar items from previous FromSoftware titles (Embers, Stones, and Gems).\n\nElden Ring Ashes of War Guide\n\nWhere to Find Ashes of War in Elden Ring\nAshes of War can obtained in the following ways:\n\nDropped by Enemies and Bosses\nPurchased from Merchants\nFound throughout the Lands Between; looted from corpses, chests, and other places of interest\n\nDuplicating
