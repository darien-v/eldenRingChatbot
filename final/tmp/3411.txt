He was tasked to guard the Rune of Death, but his failure to do so led to the Night of the Black Knives. In order for this to never happen again, he imbued the rune into his very flesh.\nThis is not an optional boss, as players must defeat it to advance to Leyndell, Ashen Capital and finish the game.\nGurranq, Beast Clergyman is an NPC variant of the first phase of this boss.\n\nCower before Maliketh, Marika’s Black Blade.\n\nElden Ring Maliketh, The Black Blade Boss\n\nThis is not an optional boss as Maliketh must be defeated to unlock Leyndell, Ashen Capital and advance the story.\nClosest Site of Grace: Beside the Great Bridge\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Maliketh, The Black Blade Location\nFrom the Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace, head west and then south up the stairs, then up the ramp past the Draconic Tree Sentinel and into the door to Beast Clergyman's boss room.

The fight takes place in a large round arena, with tall pillars throughout and a dangerous open pit around the edge. It is highly recommended to move forward into the arena as soon as you enter through the fog gate. Don't let the Clergyman engage you on the short bridge right in front of the fog gate. Beast Clergyman has several low horizontal swinging attacks, most of which you can safely jump over to close distance and counterattack. The boss also has several rock sling and air burst ranged attacks, all can be dodged by rolling forward through the animations. Occasionally, Beast Clergyman will plunge his dagger into the ground, ripping large boulders into the air at the end of the animation. These boulders float above the camera and crash back down, the damage is avoidable. Strong attacks allow for a posture break, where the player has enough time to riposte and land a heavy attack while Beast Clergyman is in recovery animation. Posture break buildup carries over into phase two, which can score you an easy riposte during the most dangerous phase of the fight.\nAt roughly half health, the second phase of the encounter begins. A brief cutscene takes place and Maliketh, the Black Blade is revealed. Sword damage from Maliketh will temporarily reduce your max health, and cause a damage over time effect. Many of Maliketh's sword attacks cause frontal cone area of effect damage that can be avoided by staying under and rolling behind the boss. Maliketh will jump high into the air and use the pillars to travel around the room during this phase of the encounter. While airborne, Maliketh uses the Black Blade to sling multiple black blades at the player, which may be dodged by rolling.\nIf Maliketh jumps into the air and plunges the Black Blade into the ground, be prepared to avoid the delayed explosion by rolling or moving away. Otherwise, pushing forward into melee range is recommended at all times. Maliketh is more likely to use regular sword attacks while in melee range, these attacks are easier to avoid. Many of the frontal cone Destined Death attacks can be avoided at the feet of and behind the boss. Strafing forward and to the right of the Maliketh will cause some sword attacks to miss completely, leaving openings to score damage. You can also roll into the boss to avoid the 360 spinning attack, and be in range to retaliate. Maliketh is most dangerous at a distance, as the boss is more likely to use ranged Destined Death attacks. Press forward and close distance as often as you can.\nThe Best Tips for Maliketh, The Black Blade:\n\nUse the pillars in the arena to block his projectiles if you need to heal.\nPractice posture breaking Beast Clergyman with heavy attacks to learn the requirements, then work on forcing phase 2 of the fight to start with the boss near a posture break. This will allow you to stun Maliketh early with only one or two heavy attacks.\nBlasphemous Claw  lets you do a special kind of parry on Maliketh.\n\nThere are only two parriable attacks: Black Blade attack (ending part, both slash and dive attack). This is indicated by white aura around his sword. \n\nStun window is larger after parrying dive than slash.\n\nA parry may also be performed briefly during Maliketh's vertical double-spin attack, which often follows the moment he lands on his sword. This window is much smaller than the Black Blade attacks.\nA successful parry stuns Maliketh for few seconds and deals minor damage to him. Also makes his damage resistance lower for the duration of stun (around 20 percent).\nThere is some risk that the player will receive damage despite a successful parry. This is because you are parrying too late. It depends on the distance where you parry which can effect the parry window. It is more likely to happen during cooperation, but can happen in solo playthrougth too.\n\nThe Crimsonburst Crystal Tear can offset the damage-over-time effect of Maliketh's attacks.\n2nd phase: It's possible to put his AI in "pacing" mode if you unlock the camera and position a pillar between you. He will circle around trying to find sight, and if you change direction repeatedly it stalls the fight completely. Delaying allows time for his HP defuff which removes max HP% (lasting 10-15 seconds) to wear off, and gives you room to plan the next move. This mostly works if fighting without summons. \n\nMelee Users\nA shield can negate his dagger swipes but be aware that his incantations will still inflict some chip damage through a 100% physical negation shield. His forward dagger lunge can be dodged by rolling into him, but be aware that he will back up a little bit with a quick sideways dagger swipe or follow up with Bestial Sling. His dagger plunge is easiest to punish.\nA lot of his incantations have very obvious tells, usually involving plunging his claw into the ground. His Bestial Sling has him hold his claw across his chest, and can be difficult to dodge given how fast it comes out. Stone of Gurranq uses a slow projectile that can be evaded easily. Both Beast Claw variations are slightly delayed after he plunges into the ground, sometimes dragging along the floor, but have a blind spot right in front of him and can be safely evaded by rolling forward.\nHe doesn't take too much to force to his second phase. Stagger him with a few good heavy attacks and he can easily fall to the phase change threshold.\nMaliketh is a lot more mobile and is more of a test of patience. However, he retains some of the blind spots of his first phase and will whiff if you get up close or behind him. He'll frequently start with a jumping wide slash that can be rolled into. A lot of his attacks will inflict a max HP debuff and a damage over time which can be lethal if his sword combos left you near death.\nTry to stick up close or behind him while he's on the ground. Wait for him to finish his airborne attacks before moving to strike.\nYou may notice his blade glow gold during some of these attacks; these show that it can be parried with the Blasphemous Claw. Catch him on the descent and he'll be stunned for a long time.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nUse high-speed, low-recovery spells like Lightning Spear or Night Comet as your main offense, because the punish windows at range are fairly short.\nThe Beast Clergyman's attacks all have relatively short range, so if you can outspace him you have plenty of room for long-reaching projectiles. Use the pillars to create space if you need it. Bestial Sling is the toughest to dodge due to the speed of the projectile, and any one clipping you can interrupt your casting animation.\nThe Clergyman begins the fight by moving towards you. If you notice he's not at full sprint, you have the room to set up and unleash a Comet Azur or Crystal Torrent to force him to phase two right away. Incantation users can use this opening behavior to inflict Scarlet Rot on him with Ekzykes's Decay. If the Clergyman starts with a full sprint, you may not have the time to pull this off.\nThe second phase is a lot tougher due to Maliketh's greater reach and mobility. Refrain from casting while he's in the air and only do so right after you've dodged his attacks. Again, the pillars can block his Black Blade projectiles but don't hug them too closely as his slashes can clip through and get you.\n\nBeast Clergyman Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSide To Side Swipe\nSwiftly swings his sword either side of him directly in front of him.\n Either roll into or away from him\n\nForward Ground Stab\n Lunges forward a short distance to stab the ground\n Roll to either side (preferably right)\n\nBestial Sling\n Collects rocks from the ground with his hand and throws them at the player\n Expect either this or a boulder toss, dodge a second before they hit you due to the speed\n\nBestial Sling (Variant 2)\n Swiftly circles the player and collects rocks while jumping and throws them as soon as he lands\n Roll a second after he lands from his dash\n\nBestial Sling (Variant 3)\n Executes a Forward Ground Stab but follows it up with a Bestial Sling directly afterwards \nDodge directly into your left (his right) to avoid the rocks\n\nBeast Claw\nRaises his hand over his head and slams into the ground, once he withdraws his hand shockwaves travel towards the player\nAvoid dodging to the side as it can catch you easily. Roll forward into his blind spot instead.\n\nLunge Swipe\nVery similar to the Bestial Sling Variant however he doesn't throw rocks but swiftly slashes from his left to his right \nStay a mid-long distance from him or dodge into his belly\n\nGround Rupture\nWith both hands he reaches up and grabs the ground, bringing up huge chunks of earth which crash down after (similar to Fallingstar Beast), however he occasionally follows this attack with a Bestial Sling so be ready to dodge\nObserve the ground as he hits the floor, there should be visual columns of dust, this is where the rocks will come from so try and stand somewhere with no dust and keep rolling away from him\n\nStone of Gurranq\nWith one hand he grabs a boulder and chucks it at you in a straight line\nEasily dodged by rolling forward or to the side\n\nQuick Slash\nMuch like Sif from Dark Souls 1, he quickly slashes in front of him and backflips away from the player\nTry and block it with a good shield or simply roll into or away from it\n\nSword Drag\nStabs sword into the ground and drags it around him from right to left\nStick to his left hip and roll into his left buttock to avoid the blade\n\nGurranq's Beast Claw\nSimilarly erupts Beast Claws from the ground however, these travel in a circle around him, tends to occur more at close range\nRoll forward into his blind spot or jump over the ground-based projectile\n\nSlash and Stab\nQuickly slashes in front of him followed by a forward stab\nEither block with a good shield or simply dodge to the right\n\nMaliketh, the Black Blade Attacks And Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nFlip And Slash\nOften the opening move to the second phase, he flip towards the player with a low sweep of his sword, may often follow it up with another swipe/ overhead slam\nRoll through the first slash and dodge the slam to punish. Maliketh appears to always start phase two with this attack. If you simply hold forward at the end of the cutscene, you can safely position yourself behind him to punish as the attack ends, no dodging necessary.\n\nPiledriver\nVery similar to Black Blade Kindred he jumps into the air and lands on his sword which is followed by an AOE explosion\nDodge the initial slam and roll away from the bossIf you move about 2 rolls' distance from Maliketh while he is still on top of his sword, he will transition into 2 overhead sweeps followed by a flurry, rather than jumping away. By rolling toward Maliketh and through the flurry, you can punish this move.\n\nBlack Blade\nBackflips into the air and slashes his sword at the player, blades will shoot from the blade towards the player at high speeds, can vary from 2-3 blades however, If it is 2 blades he will most likely follow with a Piledriver which has an AOE. If it is 3 blades he will charge towards player and perform the "Double Spin" attack while moving through the air.\nDo not panic roll, wait for about half a second after the slash begins to start rolling and count the slashes. If it is 2, copy the advice from the previous row. If it is 3, roll towards Maliketh when "Double Spin" is about to hit you. Since he is moving during the attack, the second slash will not hit you. Be careful not to stand close to an edge, since Maliketh will simply stop moving forward making the second hit near impossible to dodge. You can parry this attack on the descent with the Blasphemous Claw.\n\nQuick Black Blade\nQuick flip with a single Black Blade projectile.\nSimple to roll through or block\n\nRoar\nRoars at the player which knocks them back a few meters.\nKeep your shield up to reduce the impact, no damage is taken though. Alternatively, time a roll to avoid the impact.\n\nDestined Death\nThe most punishable attack, he slashes the floor in front of him and follows it with a overhead slam leaving his back exposed\nFor the swipe simply roll to your right and get a hit or two and for the slam roll into his rear to avoid it and punish carefully. It's best to wait a moment to punish in case he follows up with his deadly variant described below.\n\nDestined Death (followup)\nSame as previous row however, he follows with the blade circling himself twice and stabbing the ground in front of him, creating a cloud of slashes, rapidly cutting through anything in front of him.\nIf he begins to circle the blade around himself simply stay close to him and either block or dodge the swipes and dodge the stab and punish. If there is time, move behind him before the stab to avoid the slashes.\n\nDouble Spin\nSpins around twice in place with the blade in hand\nRoll twice. The timing of the second swing perfectly matches the timing of your second roll if you successfully rolled the first swing.\n\nBlind Swings\nAfter successful parry, Maliketh covers his eyes and performs a slow slash (Multiple slashes, if the player parried Piledriver attack). \nStay under him and attack before he recovers\n\nMaliketh, The Black Blade Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Jonathan Keeble\nWas originally called the Beast Pastor in the 1.00 version of the game. \nMaliketh was the half-brother and sworn Shadow of Queen Marika, to whom she entrusted the Rune of Death. Ranni the Witch stole a fragment of the Rune of Death to forge the daggers used during the Night of the Black Knives, causing a series of events that resulted in the Shattering. After which, she gave the Blasphemous Claw to her brother Rykard, to give him the power to challenge Maliketh.\nIn order to ensure that the Rune of Death was never stolen (again), Maliketh bound the blade that contained it to his own flesh.\nBug: If Tarnished dies during the second phase with the "debuff" on, they will not spawn with max HP. This applies to cooperators as well.\n\nDialogue\nINTRODUCTION\nThou, who approacheth Destined Death. I will not have it stolen from me again.\nINTRODUCTION (if Gurranq is given all Deathroots)\nTarnished, why wouldst thou... Why... Tis no matter. I hereby vow, that Destined Death shall not be stolen again.\nDURING FIGHT:\nDefeating player in phase 1: \nI shall not part with it again.\nDefeating player in phase 1 (if Gurranq is given all Deathroots): \nStay away from Destined Death.\nDefeating player in phase 2: Cower.

QUESTION
What strategies can be utilized to effectively defeat Maliketh, The Black Blade in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Use pillars to block projectiles, force phase 2 with heavy attacks, parry specific moves, offset damage-over-time effect with Crystal Tear, maintain close distance, watch for specific tells, dodge and counterattack effectively, and be cautious of HP debuffs and AoE attacks.
