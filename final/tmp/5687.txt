CONTEXT
\n\n Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy \n\nLocation\nVolcano Manor\n\nDrops\n\n130.000Rykard's Great Rune Remembrance of the Blasphemous\n\nHP\n89,613\n\nStronger VS\n\nFire\n\nWeaker to\n\nStandard\n\nSlash\n\nPierce\n\nFrostbite\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy is a two-phase Demigod Boss in Elden Ring. The God-Devouring Serpent is a massive coiled serpent found at the Volcano Manor in Mt. Gelmir, and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy is its true form that's revealed after the first phase is defeated. When Rykard offered himself up to the serpent in a pursuit of immortality, most of his followers turned on him and sought to bring him down with the Serpent-Hunter.\n\nRykard is an optional boss, and doesn't need to be defeated in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, Rykard is a shardbearer, and two of the five available shardbearers must be defeated before entering Leyndell, Royal Capital.\n\n Join the Serpent King, as family... Together, we will devour the very gods!\n\nElden Ring God-Devouring Serpent / Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nThis boss fight has two phases with the same stats but different names. You must kill God-Devouring Serpent and then Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy to win the fight, and if you die you'll start over with God-Devouring Serpent.\nClosest Site of Grace: Audience Pathway\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss \n\nCoopeartors can enter the arena only when boss HP bar is visible.\n\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring God-Devouring Serpent / Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy Location\nFrom the Audience Pathway Site of Grace, head through the gateway immediately to the south. Make sure you grab the Serpent Hunter on your left as you enter, then proceed towards the center of the room until the God-Devouring Serpent attacks. [Map Link]\nThere are two ways to reach the Audience Pathway Site of Grace:\n\nProgress to the end of the Volcano Manor legacy dungeon and take the waygate after the room with the Man-Serpent Ashes.\nComplete all three of Tanith's contracts, then agree to see him and she'll teleport you to the Audience Pathway Site of Grace. Note that if you choose this option, you won't be able to use Rykard as one of the shardbearers needed to enter Leyndell, Royal Capital, since the last contract is only available after Leyndell.\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent / Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy Combat information\n\nHealth: 30,493 HP (Serpent), 59,174 HP (Rykard)\nDefense: 115\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nImmune to critical attacks. Breaking its stance will only stun it briefly\nWeak spot: head\nDamage: Standard, Fire (God-Devouring Serpent) Standard, Pierce, Fire (Rykard)\nInflicts: Poison (God-Devouring Serpent)\nDrops 130,000, Rykard's Great Rune, Remembrance of the Blasphemous\n\nNegations (or Absorptions) - both phases are identical\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 35\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 80\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 556 / 846 / 1303\nScarlet Rot: 556 / 846 / 1303\nHemorrhage: 556 / 846 / 1303\nFrostbite: 247 / 289 / 387 / 677\n\nSleep: 556 / 846 / 1303\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs. The values after the "/"s indicate the increased resistances after each successive proc.\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP (Serpent)\n30,439\n38,474\n42,321\n44,245\n46,168\n50,016\n51,939\n53,863\n\nHP (Rykard)\n59,174\n74,795\n82,274\n86,014\n89,754\n97,233\n100,973\n104,713\n\nDefense\n115\n118\n121\n124\n130\n136\n142\n153\n\nRunes\n130,000\n260,000\n286,000\n292,500\n312,000\n318,500\n325,000\n331,500\n\n Resistances \n\nPoison\n556 / 846 / 1303\n270 / 560 / 1017\n274 / 564 / 1021\n278 / 568 / 1025\n282 / 572 / 1029\n286 / 576 / 1033\n290 / 580 / 1037\n294 / 584 / 1041\n\nScarlet Rot\n556 / 846 / 1303\n270 / 560 / 1017\n274 / 564 / 1021\n278 / 568 / 1025\n282 / 572 / 1029\n286 / 576 / 1033\n290 / 580 / 1037\n294 / 584 / 1041\n\nHemorrhage\n556 / 846 / 1303\n270 / 560 / 1017\n274 / 564 / 1021\n278 / 568 / 1025\n282 / 572 / 1029\n286 / 576 / 1033\n290 / 580 / 1037\n294 / 584 / 1041\n\nFrostbite\n247 / 289 / 387 / 677\n120 / 162 / 260 / 550\n121 / 163 / 261 / 551\n123 / 165 / 263 / 553\n125 / 167 / 265 / 555\n127 / 169 / 267 / 557\n129 / 171 / 269 / 559\n130 / 172 / 270 / 560\n\nSleep\n556 / 846 / 1303\n270 / 560 / 1017\n274 / 564 / 1021\n278 / 568 / 1025\n282 / 572 / 1029\n286 / 576 / 1033\n290 / 580 / 1037\n294 / 584 / 1041\n\nMadness\nImmune\n\nElden Ring God-Devouring Serpent / Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy Boss Guide\n\n   God-Devouring Serpent \n\n   Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy \n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for God-Devouring Serpent:\n\nUse the Serpent-Hunter Great Spear found at the beginning of the boss' chamber. \n\nCheck your equipment load (to avoid fat-rolling) after equipping the spear; it's heavy!\n\nUse the Mimic Tear Spirit Summon while equipped with the Serpent-Hunter to significantly reduce the boss' difficulty.\n\nGeneral Strategy\nBe sure to pick up the Serpent-Hunter Great Spear held by a corpse at the beginning of the boss' chamber. It has a special interaction with this boss fight in which it manifests a blade of light with every attack, significantly increasing its range and allowing players to damage both phases of the boss from outside of the magma pool he stands in.\nThe Serpent's attacks primarily consist of lunging strikes and bites. It can also perform a special grab animation with its jaws in which it slams you down twice. However, this move only deals damage once. The Serpent will sometimes raises its head up high and then slam its chin on the ground, sending magma flying outward in a very wide arc. This attack can be dodged through or blocked to reduce damage.\nIf you opted to use the Serpent-Hunter, you should constantly be poking him between his attacks. Enough hits on the head will cause the Serpent to go down briefly, allowing you a much needed window of uninterrupted attacks.\nOnce the Serpent is defeated, Phase Two begins with Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. See Rykard's page for relevant information.\nCheese Strategy\nThe God-Devouring Serpent and by extension, Rykard can be made significantly more easy by summoning the Mimic Tear Spirit while equipped with the Serpent-Hunter. The Mimic copies your current equipment and this extends to the blade of light functionality of the Serpent-Hunter. The Mimic will attack of its own volition and you will still need to dodge the boss' attacks properly but having what is essentially a second player firing blades of light at him will massively cut down the amount of time and effort required to defeat the boss.\nMelee Users\nStrategy Writeup for Melee Users\nIf player wants to beat the boss without Serpent-Hunter as a melee, he should focus on inflicting Status-Effects (Frostbite and Blood loss). Frozen Antspur Rapier will be the best tool for it, even at +0,\nMagic and Ranged Users\nStrategy Writeup for Magic Users\nIf the player wants to beat God-Devouring Serpent without Serpent-Hunter, the optimal spells would be Borealis's Mist & Ekzykes's Decay (Incantation) or Rock Sling (Sorcery) combined with source of Frostbite like Freezing Pots. Beginning of fight gives a good opportunity to apply Status Effect. \n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSnake Bite\nThe Serpent lunges from one side towards you. It will sometimes follow up with a second lunge from the opposite direction.\nDodge towards the direction the lunge is coming from.\n\nGrab Attack\nThe Serpent raises its head up high and lunges forward. If the attack connects, the snake will grab the player, slamming them twice but dealing damage only once.\nRequires precise timing to prevent the grab.\n\nPoison Spit\nThe Serpent spits several globs of poison that spread out in various directions, leaving a pool of poison on the ground momentarily.\nStay within medium range to prevent it from using this move. Do not stand in poison puddles.\n\nMagma Slam\nThe Serpent raises its head up high, tilting it to the back. It then slams its chin on the ground, sending magma flying outwards in a very wide arc in front of it.\nDodge through the magma or block it to reduce damage.\n\nMagma Upheaval\nThe Serpent raises and coils its head on its left and then plunges its face into the ground. After a short delay, it pulls its head from the ground, causing a wide magma eruption that travels forward in front of it.\nThis move is very difficult to dodge but can be blocked with a shield to significantly reduce damage.\n\nMagma Thrash\nThe Serpent raises its head up high, looking to the side with its jaws wide open. It then begins thrashing about the magma as it spins around 360 degrees, sweeping with its head and tail, sending magma splashing about in random directions.\nMaintain your distance and avoid any flying magma.\n\nRykard, Lord of Blasphemy Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nRykard, Lord of Blasphemy Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy:\n\nRykard is very weak to Frostbite, therefore inflict it at the beginning of the fight to increase damage.\nUse the Serpent-Hunter Great Spear found at the beginning of the boss' chamber. \n\nThe Great-Serpent Hunt weapon skill stuns Rykard for a brief period of time, opening him up to a weapon skill combo or a charged heavy attack. This stun occurs regardless of poise damage, and provides an opening for casting/combo attacks.\nUse the Great-Serpent Hunt skill in the 2nd phase to interrupt Rykard's Rancorcall (the one that releases dozens of homing skulls). This will stagger him and prevent the rancor skulls being released.\nCarian Filigreed Crest can help by lowering the FP consumption of skill.\n\nUse the Mimic Tear Spirit Summon while equipped with Serpent-Hunter to significantly reduce the boss' difficulty.\nBecause the fight does not begin until the player gets close enough to Rykard to activate him, a player can fast travel out of the boss arena immediately after picking up the Serpent-Hunter. Visiting a blacksmith to upgrade the Serpent-Hunter before fighting Rykard will make the fight easier. \nIf a Starlight Shard is used once at the beginning of the fight and once more during the transition from God Devouring Serpent to Rykard, Lord Of Blasphemy the Serpent-Hunters ash of war Great-Serpent Hunt can be used repeatedly to stun both phases of the boss, typically preventing him from attacking. Of note is that you should step back between attacks to prevent yourself from stepping into the lava pool.\nAvoid trying to walk directly up to Rykard, since he's surrounded by lava that will continuously damage you and stagger you out of attacks.\n\nGeneral Strategy\nRykard is first fought in his first phase as the God-Devouring Serpent. See the serpent's page for relevant details. This section pertains to Rykard in his second phase as Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. Be sure to pick up the Serpent-Hunter Great Spear held by a corpse at the beginning of the boss's chamber. It has a special interaction with this boss fight that manifests a blade of light with every attack, significantly increasing its range and allowing players to damage both phases of the boss from outside of the magma pool he stands in. The spear has a three-stab light combo with escalating damage, a two-move heavy slashing combo with slightly increasing damage on the second hit, and a two-attack special move that has a long wind-up and costs FP.\nSuccess in the Rykard boss encounter hinges on your ability to manage the multiple area effects as well as the boss's wide-arcing swings with his blade. In general, you should always dodge towards the side his sword is coming from because Rykard is a large boss with very slow swings. Dodging in the same direction that his weapon swings towards will increase the time his sword's hitbox overlaps with yours, causing a hit and each hit from Rykard is extremely painful. There is also a lot happening in the background, with debris falling all over the place. While these will not always deal damage, they can obscure your vision as Rykard is about to attack. Remain vigilant and always keep vision on the boss.\nRykard is a very slow boss and has plenty of openings in between his attacks for at least one poke with the Serpent-Hunter. There is no need to be greedy and you should prioritize being on the move, learning his patterns and dodging. Once you have his patterns down, you can consistently poke him in between almost every movement. Furthermore, being hit in the head with the Serpent-Hunter enough times will cause him to go down briefly, giving you an even bigger opportunity to deal damage.\nWhile in his second phase, he will sometimes raise his sword up high to his side, appearing to empower himself. Dozens of large flaming skulls will then come raining down from the sky, with the bulk of them homing in on you. At this point use the Great-Serpent Hunt skill in order to stagger him and interrupt the casting, as it takes a good 3-4 seconds before going off. These skulls explode after a short delay upon reaching their target or impacting with the ground. Time your dodges or sprints properly to avoid damage. This phase persists for a long time and Rykard will continue with his regular moveset as the skulls rain down. If not killed after a while, he will end this phase by raising his sword up high with both hands, channeling the flames in the sky into the blade, culminating in a giant overhead cleave.\nCheese Strategy\nRykard can be made significantly more easy by summoning the Mimic Tear Spirit while equipped with the Serpent-Hunter. The Mimic copies your current equipment and this extends to the blade of light functionality of the Serpent-Hunter. The Mimic will attack of its own volition and you will still need to dodge the boss' attacks properly but having what is essentially a second player firing blades of light at him will massively cut down the amount of time and effort required to defeat the boss.\nMelee Users\nThough there is a weapon provided at the entrance of the arena, you can still fight Rykard with other weapons if you want. With melee weapons, it's best to use frost weapons since that's a weakness of his, but using bleed works too. The magma under him doesn't deal much damage so with a bunch of health flasks and health you can easily tank through it (provided your armor and/or resistances are high enough). Get right up close and hit his body. The only downside to this is that you will take constant chip damage due to the magma you're standing on (sometimes cancelling your attack mid animation), and it'll be hard to see what attack he's doing. He also will keep sliding away, especially in phase two. A plus is that he won't be able to hit you much when you're there.\n\nMagic and Ranged Users\nDue to the special weapon used, HP flask charges are more useful than FP flask charges.\nIf the player wants to beat Rykard without Serpent-Hunter, it is crucial to use main weakness (Frostbite) and boss large size. This makes Borealis's Mist, Pest Threads and Ancient Dragons' Lightning Spear (Incantations) a good choice. In case of sorceries, Ranni's Dark Moon paired with Rock Sling is a good call.\n\nRykard, Lord of Blasphemy Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSword Combo\nRykard's most common combo involves swinging his sword from the left to the right, then right to left, ending in a stab in front of him. Note that the second swing has a slight feint where he first slams the blade's side on the ground before swinging it across to throw you off your dodge timing. Sometimes, he will not perform the stab and other times, he will perform a fourth attack by pulling the sword upwards directly after the stab, causing the ground to erupt in the area.\nDodge towards the direction his sword is coming from during the swings. His stab travels more to your right side so dodge to the left.\n\nStab Combo\nRykard holds his sword to his side in preparation for a stab. He then proceeds to quickly stab at the ground in near his target three times. He will sometimes perform a fourth upheaval attack, pulling his sword from the ground and causing the ground to erupt.\nSprint or dodge far to the side.\n\nSword & Snake Bite Combo\nRykard swings his sword from the left and follows up with bash with the serpent's head from the right. He finishes off with a lunge from the serpent head coming from the left.\nSame as his sword combo, dodge towards the direction each attack comes from.\n\nMagma Leap\nRykard leaps either forward or backwards, sending out volleys of magma in random directions upon impact.\nMaintain distance from the magma pool and move as the magma flies out.\n\nGroundshock\n1st phase only. Rykard plunges his serpent head into the ground, then after a moment pulls it up to send a magma shockwave AoE attack forward in a cone shape over the earth.\n Very difficult to dodge, can't be rolled through or jumped over. Possible to avoid by sprinting sideways if timed immediately as the animation begins. Use weapon guard (L1) to reduce damage taken if you miss sprint timing. Using Vow of the Indomitable or Raptors of the Mist will allow you to dodge it. \n\nRykard's Rancor\nRykard extends his head forward and releases a small flaming skull from his mouth that creates a fire trail along its trajectory. After a short delay, explosions are released in a cascading fashion along the trail. Note that these skulls also appear from the ground periodically, with varying trajectories.\nSimply avoid being anywhere near the trail.\n\nSnake Bite\nRykard flips his head to the left, revealing the serpent which subsequently lunges forward to bite you.\nTime your dodge to the left side.\n\nRancor Storm\nRykard raises his sword high above to his side, appearing to empower himself. Many large flaming skulls will then rain down from the sky with the bulk of them flying towards you and exploding after a short delay as they reach their target or impact with the ground. This rain of skulls will continue for quite a while and Rykard will continue on with his standard moveset as the skulls rain down.\nDodge or sprint away from the skulls before they explode. When Rykard is charging, take the time to get as many free hits in as possible before he resumes attacking. Using Great-Serpent Hunt in the beginning can interrupt his cast and will cancel the effects entirely. \n\nTaker's Flames\nIf not stunned or killed during the Rancor Storm, Rykard will begin the attack by raising his sword high above with both hands, channeling the fire into the blade. After a long moment, he will then cleave the ground directly in front of him, culminating in a fiery explosion that travels forward.\nIf Rykard is within 3-4 hits of dying, just finish him off before he finishes charging. Otherwise, sprint far to the side or time your dodge precisely as the blade lands.\n\nDialogue\nIntroduction:\nHmm... Very well.\nYou...\nJoin the Serpent King, as family...

This can now be activated at the Divine Tower of West Altus.\nAfter defeating him, you can return to the main chambers of Volcano Manor and speak to the NPCs. After reloading the area, the NPCs will leave the area, with Bernahl leaving a sword at his seat that you can continue buying his wares off of. \nAt this point, if you teleport back to Rykard's boss arena, you'll find Tanith feasting upon his remains. If you choose to attack Tanith at this time, you will be invaded by Tanith's Knight. Upon its defeat, it will drop the Aspect of the Crucible: Breath Incantation, and Tanith's clothing set consisting of the Consort's Mask, Consort's Robe, and Consort's Trousers. With this, the Volcano Manor is complete.\nPatches' quest will progress beyond the ability to receive the Magma Whip Candlestick assassination reward.\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent / Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n

QUESTION
What strategies can be used to defeat the God-Devouring Serpent and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy bosses in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Use the Serpent-Hunter Great Spear for both phases, apply Frostbite status for Rykard, exploit dodging and sneak in attacks during openings, use Mimic Tear Spirit Summon, manage area effects, and prioritize inflicting critical damage during specific attacks to defeat God-Devouring Serpent and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy.
