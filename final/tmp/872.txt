Be aggressive with your attacks and deal stance damage to get a stagger in order to maximize damage. Jump attacks on it will also work with this strategy and may result in a successful crit attack. Keep trying to circle behind him to get a clear shot for your attacks whenever it takes a brief pause between its actions. This will also take you out of its line of sight for some of its forward attacks. If you're having a difficult time, put a Scarlet Rot debuff on him or use a spirit summon so that its attack is not completely focused on you. You can also try to parry its attacks and land a frontal stab if your parry game is good.\n\nMagic and Ranged Users\n To quickly defeat this boss, be aggressive on your attacks while continuously moving back and around it forcing it to turn and approach to attack. If near, you can perform a jump attack to stagger it or break its guard for a crit attack. This will quickly deplete its HP, and if facing two bosses at the same time, may give you a chance to completely defeat the Misbegotten Warrior before the second boss encounter. \n\nMisbegotten Warrior Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nMelee Combo\nA combination of sword swings and slashes.
