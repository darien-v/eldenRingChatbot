CONTEXT
\n\n Malenia's Great Rune \n\nType\nGreat Rune\n\nEffect \n\n        Attacks dealt after taking damage recover HP. \n\nMalenia's Great Rune is a Great Rune in Elden Ring. Great Runes in Elden Ring are special items dropped by Demigod Bosses that can be equipped to acquire special passive bonuses.\n\nA Great Rune of the shardbearer Malenia.The blessing of this half-rotted rune reduces the healing power of Flask of Crimson Tears.\nAnd yet, due to the infusion of Malenia's spirit of resistance. attacks made immediately after receiving damage will partially recover HP.\nMalenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon, and her Great Rune should have been the most sacred of all.\n\nWhere to find Malenia's Great Rune in Elden Ring\nDropped as a reward for defeating Malenia, Blade of Miquella located at the Haligtree Roots Site of Grace in Miquella's Haligtree. [Map Link] Video Location\n\nElden Ring Malenia's Great Rune Use\nIf you want to use Malenia's Great Rune, you will need to activate it at the Isolated Divine Tower which can be accessed via waygate from the Divine bridge. [Map Link] After completing Crumbling Farum Azula, the Divine Bridge waypoint can only be reached via a teleportation trap in the Tower Of Return.\n\nBlack Blade Build\n\nElden Ring Malenia's Great Rune Notes & Tips\n\nWhile this rune is active, getting hit will activate a small window of roughly 5 seconds where dealing damage will slightly restore HP up to the amount before you got hit. \n\nSelf-inflicted damage such as Bloody Slash or Seppuku does not trigger this. Only enemy hits can trigger the rune's effect.\nThe amount restored per hit is dependant on the type of attack (light, heavy, charged, jumping, etc) and your weapon class. Total damage does not affect the restored HP, but rather the damage modifiers of the weapon attack performed. This makes jumping attacks and charged attacks restore more % of HP on hit.\n\nGetting hit multiple times in a row will reset the restore point to the amount of HP you had after the previous hit. E.g. If hit 1 reduces you from 500 to 400 HP, then hit 2 reduces you from 400 to 300 HP, you will only be able to restore back up to 400 HP by dealing damage.\nThere is a separate light-red HP bar that indicates how much HP you can restore through dealing damage.\nThe Flask of Crimson Tears is reduced to 70% of its normal HP recovery amount while this Great Rune is active. \n\nHaving the Great Rune just equipped (but not active) will not have any effect on the flask, only activating it with a Rune Arc will.\n\nThis rune borrows heavily from and is almost identical to a mechanic in one of From's previous games, Bloodborne, called Rally, in which the player is also able to regain their lost HP for 5 seconds after receiving damage.\n\nElden Ring Great Runes\n\nGodrick's Great Rune  ♦  Great Rune of the Unborn  ♦  Mending Rune of Perfect Order  ♦  Mending Rune of the Death-Prince  ♦  Mending Rune of the Fell Curse  ♦  Mohg's Great Rune  ♦  Morgott's Great Rune  ♦  Phantom Great Rune  ♦  Radahn's Great Rune  ♦  Rykard's Great Rune\n\n
