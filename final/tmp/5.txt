CONTEXT

Elden Ring Multiplayer contains various modes, from cooperative game styles in PvE, to competitive game modes in PvP and Invasions. Online players can make Gestures that may even include some vocal expression, and every player at close range will hear them.\nGuidelines, various mechanics, and other online information can be found on this page.\n\nElden Ring Multiplayer Coop & Online Features\n\n1 to 4 Players\nCooperative PvE\nPvP\nFextralife's group password is FEXTRA, please add it to your group passwords in settings to make signs dropped by Fextralife more obvious to you! We won't lie to you... that would give us conniptions!\nSee Colosseum Update for the new update on the recently-opened Colosseums!

Here, diverse Multiplayer Items can be used to interact with other players.\nPlayers can also set a Multiplayer Password and a Group Password from the Multiplayer Menu.\n\nSetting a Multiplayer Password will make it so you can only be matched for most multiplayer features by other people using the same password. This, however, does not avoid Invasions nor support multiplayer (e.g. summoned Hunters who activated a Blue Cipher Ring).\nThe Group Password gives special priority to certain multiplayer features from players who use that same Group Password. Meaning players are more likely to come across world messages, summon signs, bloodstains, phantoms, and so on from peers sharing a Group Password.\n\nMessage Menu\nThe message menu allows you to write messages that players in other worlds can read at the same spot that you left them. Elden Ring allows you to change the format of the message and add Gestures to the message as well.\nPlayers can rate other people's messages. When a message is rated, the HP of the player that left the message will be replenished.\n\nMultiplayer Items in Elden Ring\nPlayers are able to use Multiplayer Items to engage in the different types of multiplayer experiences.

QUESTION
Why is setting a Multiplayer Password important in Elden Ring multiplayer mode?

ANSWER
Setting a Multiplayer Password in Elden Ring is important as it allows you to be matched with other players using the same password, giving you exclusivity in multiplayer features, except Invasions and summoned Hunters with a Blue Cipher Ring.
