CONTEXT
\n\n Faith \n\nType\nMain Attribute\n\nEffect\nAttribute required to perform sacred Incantations. Also boosts magic power of faith-scaling Incantations.\n\nFaith is one of the Stats in Elden Ring. Stats refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. Faith primarily affects a player's ability to cast Incantations, as well as equipping the weapons required to cast them. It is one of the 8 Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on to level up, increasing the Stat's effectiveness and influencing their relative secondary stats. Stats such as Faith are an important aspect of character progression in Elden Ring.\n\nFaith Stat General Information\n\nFaith (FTH) is a Main Attribute that is required to cast most Incantations. It is also a requirement to cast death Sorceries and thorn sorceries. It is a primary requirement for equipping Sacred Seals, which are used to cast incantations.\nWeapons in Elden Ring have a minimum Stat requirement that needs to be met before the weapon can be wielded. In the case of spell-based weapons, most of them require investment in either the Intelligence or Faith stats, or a combination of both. For example, the Finger Seal requires 10 FTH to equip. Some weapons may also require points in Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence or Arcane in order to wield.\nWeapons are also given a Scaling Grade denoting the degree to which they scale with an attribute. Each point allocated to the Faith stat increases the effectiveness and damage dealt by Incantations cast with weapons that have Faith scaling. A weapon with a Faith scaling grade of S will benefit the most from the Faith Attribute, followed by grades A, B, C, D, and E.\nNote that attributes will incur diminishing returns at higher levels, significantly reducing their benefits after a certain point with regards to weapon scaling. This is often referred to as the 'Soft Cap'. A 'Hard Cap' also exists in which additional points in an attribute returns little to no benefit.\nWhen scaling the attack power of a melee armament, like all stats, Faith soft caps differ depending on the weapon and the damage type being scaled. Scaling on magic, fire, lightning, or holy damage is always 20/50/80. Scaling on physical damage may be 18/60/80 or 20/60/80.\nWhen scaling the sorcery scaling or incantation scaling of a Catalyst, Faith soft caps differ depending on the catalyst. The soft caps can be 18/60/80, 25/60/80, or 15/30/45. The soft caps of Faith on each catalyst are as follows: \n\nGelmir Glintstone Staff - 15/30/45\nPrince of Death's Staff - 25/60/80\nStaff of the Guilty - 18/60/80\nFinger Seal - 18/60/80\nGodslayer's Seal - 18/60/80\nGiant's Seal - 18/60/80\nGravel Stone Seal - 18/60/80\nClawmark Seal - 15/30/45\nGolden Order Seal - 15/30/45\nErdtree Seal - 25/60/80\nDragon Communion Seal - 15/30/45\nFrenzied Flame Seal - 15/30/45\n\nFaith is one of the Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on in order to level up. The ability to level up is unlocked shortly after meeting Melina for the first time near the beginning of the game.\n\nAdding Faith Scaling to Weapons\nOn weapons that do not have innate faith scaling, players can obtain certain whetblades to add specific elemental damage and affinities to a weapon when infusing it with Ashes of War. Weapons that cannot be infused with Ashes of War cannot have scalings added.\n\nName\nNotes\nLocation\n\nRed-Hot Whetblade\nWhen applying an affinity using physical or flame-type ashes of war, a base faith scaling of D can be added with Flame Art. This will also add fire damage to the weapon.\nCaelid. After defeating Radahn, found inside Redmane Castle past an Iron Maiden.\n\n Sanctified Whetblade \nWhen applying an affinity using physical or golden-type ashes of war, a base faith scaling of D can be added with Sacred. This will also add holy damage to the weapon.\nAltus Plateau. Leyndell, Royal Capital.
