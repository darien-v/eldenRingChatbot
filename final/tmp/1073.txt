They were responsible for the event known as the Night of the Black Knives, where they assassinated Godwyn the Golden with daggers imbued with a fragment of the Rune of Death stolen from Maliketh, the Black Blade. These assassins are a group of women who are said to be Numen with close connections to Queen Marika.\nThese are optional bosses as players don't have to defeat them to advance in Elden Ring. Despite being quick and hard hitters, the Black Knife Assassins are easily staggered and having Spirit Ashes to distract them can help significantly. The variant in the Sage's Cave is invisible, though there are multiple methods available to pinpoint her location during the fight, the easiest of which is using the Sentry's Torch. Black Knife Assassins drop the Assassin's Crimson Dagger, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Black Knifeprint, Concealing Veil, or Black Knife depending on which assassin was defeated.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. They can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items.\nLesser Black Knife Assassin is the normal enemy form of this boss. Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader is another variant of this boss.\nThe spirit of a Black Knife Assassin can be summoned for aid in battle by using the Black Knife Tiche Spirit Ashes.\n\n The assassins that carried out the deeds of the Night of the Black Knives were all women, and rumored to be Numen who had close ties with Marika herself. \n\nElden Ring Black Knife Assassin Location\nBlack Knife Assassin can be found in:\n\nDeathtouched Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nBlack Knife Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nSage's Cave [More Info] [Map Link]\nSainted Hero's Grave [More Info] [Map Link]\n\nBlack Knife Assassin Combat information\n\nStance: 80\nParriable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being stance broken\nDamage: Standard, Slash, Pierce, Holy\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Black Knife Assassin Boss Guide\n\nBlack Knife Assassin Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Black Knife Assassin:\n\nUse the Lone Wolves or Godrick Soldiers.\nMagic Glintblade can make this boss laughably easy, as it tends to dodge while the spell is casted, meaning that it does not dodge the projectile itself.\n\nMELEE USERS\nThe Assassin can be easily staggered, and the Lone Wolves Ashes can distract her, deal a lot of damage, and leave openings to land some free hits. Otherwise, use a fast weapon to keep her staggered so she can't attack you back. They also have rather low health, so it's often worthwhile to trade damage and just plan to outlast her.\nThe safest way to attack her is to wait for her Helmsplitter and use her recovery time to set up a backstab. You can also try parrying her, but it's not recommended as her attacks are fast and hard to predict and she tends to move around a lot.\nMAGIC AND RANGED USERS\nIntelligence: Keep your distance and use ranged attacks. You can use Spirit Ashes to distracted her, or just roll and run away to keep distance between you. Carian Slicer is a fast melee spell that deals high damage for its cost, and can be cast repeatedly to possibly stunlock the boss. Magic Glintblade (Prisoner) can be used over Pebble to counter her ability to dodge projectiles.\nFaith: Same strategy as stated above. Catch Flame can be used the same as way as Carian Slicer, as it deals rather high damage for its speed. Flame Sling could be useful, but her tendency to dodge could make the spell less useful.\n\nBlack Knife Assassin Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nQuick Slash\nSlashes her dagger in various directions, often twirling around as well\nBlocking can cause her to ricochet and break her out of her combo. Otherwise, dodge away and wait out the rest of the combo. This attacks is also parriable at the point when her dagger is raised above her shoulder.\n\nLunging Stab\nStabs her dagger straight ahead, either overhand or underhand\nBlocking can cause her to ricochet and break her out of her combo. Otherwise, dodge away and wait out the rest of the combo.\n\nFeint Attack\nLeaps forward with one fake counterclockwise slash followed by the real clockwise slash\nThe first slash isn't real and can't hurt you (but also can't be parried). Wait until after it's done to dodge away or you'll get caught be the real slash.  Alternatively, parry after the initial slash and as her body twists and her blade comes near to ground to her left.\n\nSpinning Retreat\nSpins clockwise followed by a clockwise slash, then jumps to her left\nRoll to your left to get distance from her and allow her to finish her combo\n\nBlade-Dragging Sweep\nPlunges her knife into the ground and pivots around it, followed by a clockwise slash\nRun a short distance away when you see her dagger enter the ground, then land a hit/backstab once the attack is finished.  Alternatively, parry her towards the end of the animation as the blade comes to the ground on her left and the final set of sparkes fly.\n\nHelmsplitter\nJumps in the air before slamming her dagger into the ground\nRoll as she starts her descent. Take advantage of the long recovery time to get in a few hits or line up a backstab.\n\nLunging Grab\nLifts her left hand above her shoulder then lunges forward. If it hits, she stabs the player in the back for massive damage\nEither roll towards her raised arm or stagger her as soon as you notice her lifting her hand. If you dodge successfully, this is a great opportunity to get in an attack\n\nDecoy Lunge\nLunges low to her right and raising her dagger high above her shoulder, sweeps the dagger across to her left before performing a back-handed slash from low on the ground, sending sparkes flying.\nRun away, or parry her when her dagger is to her left, just before she drags it on the ground with sparks flying.\n\nSlashing Blade of Death\nCharges her dagger with red flame and fire a horizontal arc of flame at you. If it hits, continuously drains your health for a time. Usually used when the player is some distance away.\nRoll into the projectile as it approaches, or roll to either side.  Alternative, use a shield with the Carian Retalian Ash of War equipped to parry the projectile for some extra damage.\n\nJumping Blade of Death\nCharges her dagger with red flame, leaps into the air then unleashes a series of Death-imbued slashes at you. If it hits, it is likely to one-shot you.  It will also continuously drains your health for a time. Usually used when the player is some distance away.\nRun away from her as far as possible, then dodge at the last moment in case you are caught on the edge of the Blades of Death.  The hit box of this attack extends some distance forward as well as behind her.\n\n: Attack can be parried     : Attack can be spell parried\n\nBlack Knife Assassin (Standard) Combo Chart\n\n BLACK KNIFE ASSASSIN DEATHTOUCHED CATACOMBS \n\nDrops\n1,600Assassin's Crimson Dagger\n\nHP\n1,668\n\nElden Ring Black Knife Assassin Boss (Deathtouched Catacombs)\n\nOptional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Deathtouched Catacombs\nMultiplayer allowed for this boss\nYou can summon Spirit Ashes for this boss\n\nBlack Knife Assassin Combat Information\n\nHealth: 1,668 HP\nDefense: 101.3\nDrops  1,600, Assassin's Crimson Dagger\nThis assassin has only half of her health and can be easily killed by attacking aggressively and trading damage\nThis assassin has much more limited combos, moves much more slowly, and can't do the Blade of Death or Helmsplitter attacks.

Summoned spirits are also unaffected by her invisibility and can be used to poinpoint her location, as can the flames left on the ground by Bear Witness!.\nIf you don't have access to the strategies above, she can still be defeated by looking for the dust clouds and water deformations she leaves behind as she moves around. When she charges you (again look for the dust clouds/water deformations), always stand your ground and time your attacks to land just before she reaches you. She will either be hit by your initial attacks or she will dodge by jumping backwards before immediately charging directly at you again, in which case simply attack again. She almost never retreats from this second charge so as long as you time your attacks correctly, damage is all but guaranteed. Each time she is hit, she will almost always retreat before charging at you again after a brief period of time. She will sometimes aggro on you continuously, it is best to avoid these by dodging away as much as possible until she loses aggro and charges you again. \n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n3,929\n5,812\n6,393\n6,683\n6,974\n7,555\n7,846\n8,136\n\nDefense\n110\n118\n120\n123\n129\n135\n141\n153\n\nRunes\n9,000\n27,000\n29,700\n30,375\n32,400\n33,075\n33,750\n34,425\n\n Resistances \n\nPoison\nImmune\n\nScarlet Rot\nImmune\n\nHemorrhage\nImmune\n\nFrostbite\n329 / 427 / 717 / 1174\n355 / 453 / 743 / 1200\n360 / 458 / 748 / 1205\n365 / 463 / 753 / 1210\n370 / 468 / 758 / 1215\n376 / 474 / 764 / 1221\n381 / 479 / 769 / 1226\n386 / 484 / 774 / 1231\n\nSleep\nImmune\n\nMadness\nImmune\n\nBlack Knife Assassin (Sage's Cave) Combo Chart\n\n BLACK KNIFE ASSASSIN SAINTED HERO'S GRAVE \n\nDrops\n10,800Black Knife\n\nHP\n5,412\n\nElden Ring Black Knife Assassin Boss (Sainted Hero's Grave)\n\nOptional field boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Sainted Hero's Grave\nMultiplayer allowed for this boss\nYou can summon Spirit Ashes for this boss\nYou can ride Torrent for this boss\n\nBlack Knife Assassin Combat information\n\nHealth: 5,412 HP\nDefense: 113.3\nPoise: 80\nYou can sneak up on this assassin for a backstab critical.\nDrops 10,800, Black Knife\nBeware of her Leaping Blade attack, as it will not only knock you off your horse and leave you vulnerable, but she will follow up with a critical hit and deal massive damage.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: 334 / 432 / 722 / 1179\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.
