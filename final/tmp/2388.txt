Status Effects can be applied on both enemies and players alike. Status Effects are triggered after a buildup meter is filled by repeated application of attacks that cause the effect. Both players and enemies can have varying resistances to a given Status Effect.\n\nElden Ring Poison Guide\nPoison is a status effect that builds up through repeated application of the effect. Poison is inflicted via various means including Weapons, Skills, Spells and Consumables. Once the Poison meter is filled, the effect is triggered and the target is dealt damage slowly over a long period.\nNote that the higher is your immunity to Poison, the longer it takes for its gauge to fill.\nPoison build up or the Poison effect itself can be removed by consuming Neutralizing Boluses. Players can also use the Cure Poison incantation to remove Poison.\n\nPoison Effects in Elden Ring\nPoison causes small amounts of damage every second and lasts for a very long time or until removed.\n\nThere are two main categories of Poison; regular Poison and Deadly Poison. Generally speaking, the latter will do a concentrated, slightly higher DPS but for a shorter duration (and overall less damage in total).\nPoison inflicts differing levels of damage depending on the weapon used. For most weapons, it inflicts (0.07% Max HP) + 7 per second for 90 seconds, for a total of 6.3% Max HP + 630 damage over its full duration.\nFor the Serpentbone Blade and Venomous Fang, deadly poison inflicts (0.14% Max HP) + 14 per second for 30 seconds, for a total of 4.2% Max HP + 420 damage over its full duration.\nFor the Fetid Pot and Roped Fetid Pot, deadly poison inflicts (0.14% Max HP) + 12 per second for 30 seconds, for a total of 4.2% Max HP + 360 damage over its full duration.\nSome enemies that cause poison build-up inflict it for (0.42% Max HP) + 18 per second for 30 seconds, for a total of 12.6% Max HP + 540 damage over its full duration.\nPoison Spraymist has a stronger, unique form of deadly poison that inflicts (0.21% Max HP) + 21 for 30 seconds, for a total of 6.3% Max HP + 630 damage over its full duration. This unique deadly poison is stronger than Scarlet Rot.\nSome Arcane-scaling poison weapons may be more effective at poisoning an enemy. For example the Serpent Bow will cause poison to build up more rapidly with a higher Arcane stat. But the resulting damage is the same.\nPoison effects can be mitigated by raising the Immunity stat. Immunity can be raised by adding points into Vigor. It can also be boosted temporarily by using Consumables such as Cured Immunizing Meat.\n\nElden Ring Poison Effect on Players\nThis section lists information pertaining to the Poison effect and its relation to Players\n\nPoison Sources (Weapons)\nThe following weapons cause the Poison effect:\n\nSerpent Bow (Bow) (+15 base to arrows)\nVenomous Fang (Claw) (72) [Deadly Poison]\nSerpentbone Blade (Katana) (66) [Deadly Poison]\nCoil Shield (Shield) (72) [Deadly Poison]\nAnt's Skull Plate (Shield) (90)\n\nPoison Sources (Skills & Spells)\nThe following Skills & Spells cause the Poison effect:\n\nSkills: \n\nAsh of War: Poison Moth Flight\nAsh of War: Poisonous Mist\nSkill: Viper Bite\n\nIncantations: \n\nPoison Armament\nPoison Mist\n\nPoison Sources (Others)\nThe following are other sources of the Poison effect:\n\nSpirit Ashes: \n\nLand Squirt Ashes\nSpirit Jellyfish Ashes\nMiranda Sprout Ashes\n\n Arrows: \n\nPoisonbone Arrow\nPoisonbone Arrow (Fletched)\nSerpent Arrow\nPoisonbone Bolt\n\nConsumables: \n\nPoison Grease\nDrawstring Poison Grease\n\nThrowables: \n\nPoisonbone Dart\nPoison Spraymist\nPoison Pot\nRoped Poison Pot\nFetid Pot [Deadly Poison]\nRoped Fetid Pot [Deadly Poison]\nPoisoned Stone\nPoisoned Stone Clump\n\nMitigating Poison\nThe following Equipment, Skills, Spells and Items offer resistance to the Poison effect:\n\nEquipment: \n\nMushroom Set\nGuardian Set\nAnt's Skull Plate\nSpiralhorn Shield\nPerfumer's Shield\n\nTaslimans: \n\nImmunizing Horn Charm\nMottled Necklace\n\nConsumables: \n\nSpeckled Hardtear\nImmunizing Cured Meat\nImmunizing White Cured Meat\nDappled Cured Meat\nDappled White Cured Meat\n\nCuring Poison\nThe following Skills, Spells and Items can be used to remove the Poison effect:\n\nConsumables: \n\nSpeckled Hardtear\nNeutralizing Boluses\n\nIncantations: \n\nCure Poison\nFlame Cleanse Me\nLord's Aid\nLaw of Regression\n\nElden Ring Poison Effect on Enemies\nThis section lists information pertaining to the Poison effect and its relation to Enemies and Bosses.\n\nEnemies that cause Poison\nThe following Enemies, Bosses, NPC, Invaders and Environmental hazards can inflict the Poison effect on players:\n\nEnvironmental hazard \n\nPools of poison encountered at these locations \n\nnorth-east of Castle Morne\nFringefolk Hero's Grave (entrance)\nSeethewater Cave\nShaded Castle\nStillwater Cave\nTombsward Cave\nWitchbane Ruins\nnear Village of the Albinaurics\n\nTraps set by Vulgar Militiamen at these locations:\n\nnorth of bridge near Lenne's Rise\nRuin-Strewn Precipice\n\nNPC & Invaders \n\nGreat-Jar Warrior (random chance when playing online, present offline)\nMaleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan\n\nEnemy\n\nGiant Miranda Sprout (Toxic variation)\nHaligtree Soldier\nLand Squirt\nMiranda Sprout (Toxic variation)\nRevenant\nServant of Rot\nSpirit Jellyfish\n\nBoss \n\nFia's champions (random chance when playing online)\nGod-Devouring Serpent\nMiranda the Blighted Bloom\nRoyal Revenant\n(Stray) Mimic Tear (if players enters arena wtih ability to inflict Poison)\nValiant Gargoyle & Valiant Gargoyle (Twinblade) (only boss encounter)\n\nPoison Vulnerable\nThe following Enemies, NPC, NPC Invaders and Bosses are weak to the Poison effect. Weakness indicates a target has a much lower threshold for the effect, requiring fewer applications to fill the build up meter and trigger the effect.\n\nEnemy \n\nAnimal-type enemies\nAzula Beastman\nBaleful Shadow\nBattlemage\nDuelist\n\nNPC & Invaders \n\nBloody Finger Nerijus\nMad Tongue Alberich\n\n Boss \n\nBattlemage Hugues\nBeastman of Farum Azula\nCommander Niall\nCommander O'Neil\nDemi-Human Chief\nDemi-Human Queens (Gilika, Maggie, Margot)\nEsgar, Priest of Blood\nFell Twins\nFia's Champion\nFrenzied Duelist\nGodskin-type enemy (Apostle, Noble, Duo) - excluding spirit duo\nGrave Warden Duelist\nMad Pumpkin Head\nNecromancer Garris\nRunebear\n\nPoison Resistant\nThe following Enemies, NPC, Invaders and Bosses are resistant to the Poison effect.
