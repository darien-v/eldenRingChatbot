The Coil Shield is a Shield that scales primarily with Strength. Small Shields usually weigh very little and have the least form of protection from attacks. They are often used by players who prefer parrying rather than blocking. Its lighter weight also makes it ideal for quick, agile characters with low equipment weight capacity.\n\nArmament designed for gladiatorial combat. rises above its peers as a particularly showy specimen.\nThe sculpted bronze snake is a poisonous breed, boosting the wielder's resistance to poison.\n\nWhere to Find Coil Shield in Elden Ring\nThe Coil Shield can be found at the following location:\n\nThe Coil Shield is located on a body in Volcano Cave, northeast of the Ninth Mt. Gelmir Campsite Site of Grace in Mt. Gelmir. From the cave grace, head into the large open room. From there, take the right-most tunnel (northwest) and follow it to the end. Drop down onto the small cliff below. Turn around and go into the tunnel. The shield will be on a body in the room ahead. Note: There will be an ambush of enemies, so you may want to clear the room first.

Once poison is applied, it then does a burst of damage, and the enemy is aggroed.\n\nEven though the Viper Bite shield skill applies deadly poison, attacking with the shield itself (by two-handing it) inflicts normal poison.\nThis shield cannot be infused with Ashes of War nor buffed with Magic and Consumables.\nIncreases Immunity by 40.\nSell Value: 100\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
