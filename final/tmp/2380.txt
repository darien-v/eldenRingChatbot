Status Effects can be applied on both enemies and players alike. Status Effects are triggered after a buildup meter is filled by repeated application of attacks that cause the effect. Both players and enemies can have varying resistances to a given Status Effect.\n\nElden Ring Sleep Guide\nSleep is a status effect that builds up through repeated application of the effect. Sleep is inflicted via various means including Weapons, Skills, and Consumables. Once the sleep meter is filled, the effect is triggered and the target is put to sleep, rendering them vulnerable to a Critical Attack.\n\nSleep Effects in Elden Ring\nThe Sleep effect puts a target to sleep, rendering them unable to move or attack. The Sleep status is useful for avoiding difficult encounters or putting enemies in a vulnerable state and allowing for a Critical Attack which deals Critical Damage.\n\nIn PvE, triggering sleep may have one of 2 effects: \n\nEnemy falls asleep until they are hit for max 60 seconds. They are immobile in this state and can be riposted\nIn mid-animation of falling asleep they shake their head and return to combat. \n\nThe Sleep effect can be mitigated by raising your Focus. Focus can be improved by adding points into Mind.\nOther players cannot be riposted when put to sleep, but it does give enough time to get in a charged R2 in most cases\n\nElden Ring Sleep Effect on Players\n\nPlayers inflicted with sleep by other players are stunned for roughly 1 second.\nSleep drains the FP by (Max FP * 0.1) + 30.\n\nSleep Sources (Weapons)\nThe following weapons cause the Sleep effect:\n\nSword of St Trina (Straight Sword) (66)\nSt. Trina's Torch (Torch) (72)\n\nSleep Sources (Skills & Spells)\nThe following Skills & Spells cause the Sleep effect:\n\nMists of Slumber\nFires of Slumber\n\nSleep Sources (Others)\nThe following are other sources of the Sleep effect:\n\nSleep Pot\nSt. Trina's Arrow\nSleepbone Arrow\nSleepbone Arrow (Fletched)\nSleepbone Bolt\nSoporific Grease\nMimic Tear Ashes (Spirit Ashes, if you have sleep weapon in your inventory)\nDolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet\n\nMitigating Sleep\nThe following Equipment, Skills, Spells and Items offer resistance to the Sleep effect:\n\nFocus from Mind\nFocus from Armor\nClarifying Horn Charm\nMottled Necklace\nRift Shield\nShield of the Guilty\nSpiralhorn Shield\nClarifying Cured Meat\nClarifying White Cured Meat\nDappled Cured Meat\nDappled White Cured Meat\nSpeckled Hardtear\n\nCuring Sleep\nThe following Skills, Spells and Items can be used to remove Sleep buildup:\n\nLord's Aid\nLaw of Regression\nLucidity\nStimulating Boluses\nSpeckled Hardtear\n\nElden Ring Sleep Effect on Enemies\nThis section lists information pertaining to the Sleep effect and its relation to Enemies and Bosses.\n\nEnemies that cause Sleep\nThe following Enemies, NPC, Invaders and Bosses can inflict the Sleep effect on players:\n\nEnemy \n\nGiant Somniferous Crab (Liurnia and Consecrated Snowfield)\n\nNPC & Invaders \n\nGreat-Jar Warrior (random chance when playing online, not present offline)\n\n Boss \n\n(Stray) Mimic Tear (If player can inflict Sleep)\n\nSleep Vulnerable\nThe following Enemies, NPC, Invaders and Bosses are weak to the Sleep effect. Weakness indicates a target has a much lower threshold for the effect, requiring fewer applications to fill the build up meter and trigger the effect.\n\nEnemies \n\nAlbinauric (all generations)\nBasilisk\nCastle Exile\nCelebrant\nClayman\nCrab\n Crystal Sorcerer\nDemi-Human\nDemi-Human Chief\nDigger\nFallen Hawk Soldier\nGiant Crab\nGiant Crayfish\nGiant Miranda Sprout\nGlintstone Zombie\nGuardian\nLiving Jar\nManeuverable Flamethrower\nMan-Serpent\nMiner\nMiranda Sprout\nMisbegotten\nMonstrous Crow\nOracle Envoy\nPutrid Corpse\nSerpent Snail\nServant of Rot\nTroll\nWandering Noble\nVulgar Militant\nWildlife creatures\n\nNPC & Invaders \n\nN/A\n\nBosses\n\nBeastman of Farum Azula\nBols, Carian Knight \nGreat Wyrm Theodorix\nGodskin-type enemies (Apostle, Noble, Duo, Spirit encounter)\nMagma Wyrm (regular, Makar)\nJuvenile Scholar present during Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon boss battle (1st phase)\nSoldier of Godrick\nSpirit-Caller Snail\nStonedigger Troll\n\nSleep Resistant\nThe following Enemies, NPC, Invaders and Bosses are resistant to the Sleep effect.
