Two  Crucible Knight spirits can also be summoned by the Spirit-Caller Snail boss of the the Road's End Catacombs.\n16 Crucible Knights in total can be fought throughout the Lands Between, though two of them have evidently died and can only be fought post mortem in spirit form.\n\nElden Ring Crucible Knight Locations\n\nStormhill Evergaol [More Info] [Map Link]\nStormveil Castle [More Info]\nSiofra River [More Info]\n2 in Siofra Aqueduct [More Info]\n2 in Leyndell, Royal Capital [More Info]\n2 in Crumbling Farum Azula [More Info]\n\nCrucible Knight Combat information\n\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nDamage: Standard, Strike, Pierce, Holy (Phase 2)\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 35\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 35\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 20\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\n Notes\n\nAttacks are very difficult to block\nGiant Hunt, Stamp Upper and Lion's Claw will stagger them \n\nStamp Upper can dodge some of their attacks by crouching under the blade\n\nLion's Claw will grant you extra poise to prevent you from being interrupted by their attacks, using this skill 3 times in a row will stance break them, allowing you to perform a critical hit and heal before they can get up.\nIn certain areas, they can fly off a cliff and die if they use the wing swoop attack\n\nElden Ring Crucible Knight (Sword) Boss Guide\n\nCrucible Knight (Sword) Boss Video Guide\n\nCrucible Knight (Sword) Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Crucible Knight:\n\nUse Cuckoo Glintstones to hit their back when its shield is facing you.\nGiant Hunt and Stamp (Upward Cut) can stagger it out of many of its moves.\nFor co-op, Ancient Lightning Spear (Bolt of Gransax skill) is useful - when fully charged, it makes Crucible Knight flinch.\nJumping attacks can be a good counter to their charge attack.\n\nMelee Users\nCrucible Knight's attacks are slow and easy to predict, but hit very hard when they land. Take your time, don't panic, and don't go for more attacks than you have time for—trading damage is not the way to win this fight. Dodge multiple times until its combo is done, then counterattack. Don't be afraid to dodge forward through attacks, as this can put you in better position. Be particularly careful of its Seismic Wave attack, which hits a wide area but can easily be jumped and (with more difficulty) rolled.\nParrying: Because its attacks are quite easy to predict, Parrying is a great way to get in damage consistently. Most of its Phase 1 attacks are parriable and you can often parry several in a row, but be prepared to roll if you see it preparing to do a Shield Bash or Seismic Wave.\nAvoid Status: Not only does Crucible Knight have high resistance to all status ailments, its aggressive attack patterns make it hard to land frequent hits. This makes status ailments a poor strategy. It's much better to use a weapon that does a high amount of raw damage than one whose power comes from building up Poison or Hemorrhage.\nHeal Decisively: Crucible Knight has a tendency to do an attack when you try to heal with your flask when it isn't in an attack or recovery animation. This makes it very risky to heal even at a large distance between you and it. Heal only during recovery animations you KNOW the Crucible Knight can't get out of, such as Flying Dive and Seismic Combo.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nRoll directly away from its attacks to keep your distance. Seismic Wave is the most challenging, because it's hard to reliably dodge by rolling away; you can instead jump away to avoid this, or roll to either side.\nChip Away: Although the Crucible Knight's shield will block many magic spells, it'll still take chip damage. You can whittle away its health very effectively by spamming spells if you have enough Cerulean Flasks. In addition to the chip damage through the shield, you'll be able to get some full hits in when its guard is down during an attack or recovery.\n\nCrucible Knight (Sword) Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwing\nSwings its sword in various directions\nDodge diagonally forward to avoid follow-ups, then land a hit if you're in a safe location\n\nLunging Stab\nRuns towards you then stabs its sword straight ahead. This attack has a surprisingly long hitbox and is commonly used when you are trying to heal.\nDodge to your left so you can counterattack on the side without the shield.\n\nRunning Slash\nRuns towards you with its sword held against its left shoulder, then swings clockwise. Often used to try to prevent you from healing.\nDodge diagonally forward to prevent its follow-up, then land a hit if you're in a safe location.\n\nShield Bash\nHunches down behind its shield and takes a few steps towards you before lifting it up in the air\nDodge into or around its shield, then attack back during the long recovery period\n\nGrinding Swing\nDrags its sword along the ground to its left sending up sparks, then slashes it upwards\nDodge in any direction. Or, a well-timed parry. Or, get a few attacks in, and parry at the last second.\n\nSeismic Wave\nRaises its left knee with its sword out to one side, then stomps creating a shockwave along the ground\nJumping is the most reliable way to avoid this, but can take some practice if you're used to rolling. Rolling left, right, or forwards also works, but rolling backwards has much tighter timing and is not recommended.\n\nSeismic Combo\nHolds its sword aloft while doing a Seismic Wave, then slams it down in front. If the player is in range, it spins clockwise slashing twice with its sword.\nIt's safest to jump backwards and get out of range for the rest of the combo, but you can also dodge once to the side and then again backwards. Only the sword swings are parriable\n\nOrdovis's Vortex\nSpins its greatsword behind its head and then slams it down, causing a small explosion. Only Crucible Knight Ordovis and Tanith's Knight can do this move.\nRun back during the long windup. If you time it correctly, you can dodge around them to get in a hit or two. Also, the attack is slow enough that you can get in some hits and still have enough time to parry.\n\nPhase 2\n\nPhase Transition\nRaises its right knee and stomps, releasing a small blast of holy energy. This is always the first attack it does in Phase 2, and always followed by a Flying Dive.\nWalk backwards, or roll if you're wanting to be careful, and prepare for a Flying Dive.\n\nFlying Dive\nGrows a pair of golden wings and leaps into the sky, then dives towards you with sword outstretched\nRoll towards it once its sword is level with the ground. This attack can be jumped over\n\nTail Spin\nGrows a small golden tail and swings it in a circle counterclockwise. Usually uses this attack after any combo if you're in melee range in Phase 2 once but can also rarely do 2 of these in a row or begin a combo with this attack.\nRoll to your right as soon as you see the tail. The attack comes out very quickly so make sure you are focused so you have enough reaction time to dodge. Do NOT try to punish any other attack in Phase 2, especially if you are using a melee weapon. However, you can punish this attack by doing a light attack once after you dodge, easier to do this with fast weapons like daggers.\n\nGreat Tail Spin\nGrows a large golden tail and swings it in a circle clockwise. The tail then gets even larger and spins in another circle. Only used below 40% health and also only ever used after Flying Dive.\nIf you don't immediately chase after the Crucible Knight after Flying Dive, the first tail swing will automatically miss you. However, you will usually always be in range of the second tail swing. If you are further than approximately 5 metres away, dodge to your right after seeing the second tail. Otherwise dodge roll twice as soon as you see both tails respectively.\n\nFire Breath\nGrows a large throat sac and walks forward while breathing fire in a conical area in front of it.\nRun away when you see the bag on its throat inflate.\n\nFire Breath Retreat\nIt will grow a large throat sac, jump backwards, and breathes a short-ranged burst of fire.\nRoll away when you see it jump back.\n\n: Attack can be parried\nCrucible Knight Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nLate-game Crucible Knight are affected by healing incantations.\nOther Notes & Tips go here\n\nCrucible Knight (Sword) Combo Chart\n\nCrucible Knight (Spear) Boss Guide\n\nCrucible Knight (Spear) Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Crucible Knight:\n\nUse Rock Sling (3-4 hits will break its stance)\n\nMelee Users\nThe fight against this boss is hard but very well balanced, it makes quick heavy attacks and moves around the field very quickly. But your advantage is that it does not have a great pool of Health. When you face a spear knight with melee, try to keep close and stay behind. You can summon spirit ashes if you choose to.  Keep circling to avoid their line of sight, therefore avoiding their hit range making it easier for you to parry or roll through any attacks. This will also put you in a better position to attack. \nWith the knights,  it is recommended to parry their attacks rather than avoid due to their poise and stamina. At mid range, make sure to back up and roll away from these hits. If it performs a stab, block it with your shield if you brought one with you. It is possible to interrupt some of its attacks. If given a window, deal a critical hit then when they are down, follow up with a series of attacks. Their hp should deplete quickly due to their smaller health pool. \nUse a combination of baiting and waiting for these windows while parrying other attacks and dodging into another position until its hp its depleted. If it comes in for a grab attack, avoid it to refrain from taking a great a mount of damage. \nMagic and Ranged Users\nThe Knight can be attacked from a far distance before it comes into battle. Ride your mount. Keep distance, reload and drink mana potions while keeping distance. This boss takes a lot of damage against Spells. Use your heavy handed spells and continue to circle and reposition behind it. If you want to keep a further distance, there is a roof nearby where you can position yourself where it can't reach you. You can continue to deal any kind of ranged attacks from here. \nIf not, be weary of its quick lunges and dashes that are quick actions. Be ready to dash back and continue to attack until its health bar is depleted. \n\nCrucible Knight (Spear) Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwing\nSwings its spear in various directions\nDodge diagonally forward to avoid follow-ups, then land a hit if you're in a safe location; or guard and attack back quickly before it combos\n\nThrust\nThrusts its spear forward\nDodge to the side\n\nLunging Thrust\nRuns towards you then thrusts its spear straight ahead\nDodge to the side and land a quick hit\n\nSpear Slam\nRaises its spear above its head then slams its down onto the ground, kicking up dirt\nDodge to the side and land a quick hit\n\nDouble Strike\nSwings its spear clockwise into the ground, kicking up dirt, and then counterclockwise back out again\nDodge towards its right side and land a hit while it's still locked into the attack\n\nSeismic Wave\nRaises its left knee with its sword out to one side, then stomps creating a shockwave along the ground\nJumping is the most reliable way to avoid this, but can take some practice if you're used to rolling. Rolling left, right, or forwards also works, but rolling backwards has much tighter timing and is not recommended.\n\nSiluria's Woe\nHolds up its spear and starts spinning it, creating a cone of holy energy, then thrusts it forward shooting an energy spiral. This is usually limited to Phase 2, but can be used in response to item use in Phase 1\nRoll as soon as it begins to step forward.\n\nPhase 2\n\nPhase Transition\nRaises its right knee and stomps, releasing a small blast of holy energy. This is always the first attack it does in Phase 2, and always followed by a Flying Dash\nWalk backwards, or roll if you're nervous, and prepare for a Flying Dash\n\nFlying Dash\nGrows a pair of golden wings and leaps into the sky with holy energy whirling around its spear, then quickly dives forward and creates an explosion where it lands\nRoll forward as you see its wings become vertical\n\nHorn Impale\nSummons a long horn of holy light on its hand and swings it forward, impaling you if it hits. Since this is a grab attack, it cannot be blocked.\nDodge back and to your left. This attack can come out very quickly and deals a lot of damage.\n\nHorn Shoulder Charge\nSummons horns on its shoulder and shoves them towards you, dashing to cover distance if necessary.\nDodge forward and to your right when you see it start to move\n\n: Attack can be parried\n\nCrucible Knight (Spear) Combo Chart\n\n Crucible Knight  Stormhill Evergaol  \n\nDrops\n2,100Aspects of the Crucible: Tail\n\nHP\n2,782\n\nElden Ring Crucible Knight Boss (Stormhill Evergaol)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Stormhill Shack\nMultiplayer is not allowed for this boss\nYou cannot summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Crucible Knight Location\nThis Crucible Knight can be found in Stormhill Evergaol, which is the circular mark clearly visible on the map to the southeast of Stormhill Shack.

Drop off this to a ledge below and follow the route until you reach a ledge overlooking the sea. This should crumble beneath your feet; if it doesn't, roll or swing your weapon to trigger it. Once you fall down, you should see the Crucible Knight.
