QUESTION
Why should one consider stacking Thorny Cracked Tear with Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis, but avoid stacking it with Comet Azur in Elden Ring?

Stacking Thorny Cracked Tear with Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis provides increased damage by 9%, 13%, and 20%, but it should be avoided with Comet Azur as they do not stack.
