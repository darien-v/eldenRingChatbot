The Envoy's Horn scales primarily with Faith, Dexterity, and Strength.\n\nGolden horn of the Oracle Envoys. Profoundly weighty, its blows are sure to be felt.\nOriginally an instrument, but one that cannot be sounded by a mere human. Or perhaps it is too early to sound the call.\n\nWhere to Find Envoy's Horn in Elden Ring\nThe Envoy's Horn weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nChance to drop from the Oracle Envoys. \n\nCan be farmed in Leyndell, Royal Capital. They are easily found in the East Capital Rampart area upon first entering the city. Elden Ring Map Link\nCan be farmed at the Haligtree Canopy Site of Grace. There are three east of the Grace.\n\nThe first one after the Grace has a high chance to fall off of the branch and into the void. However, a second one can be found on a much wider branch on the next level directly below it. This branch can be reached by jumping to the corpse on a stack of mushrooms. This is the most efficient way that you can kill one repeatedly and should it not drop anything you can use the map to return to the Grace. \n\nVideo Location\n\nElden Ring Envoy's Horn Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Oracular Bubble "Blow on the horn to release a magic bubble.The bubble floats gently through the air towards its target."\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nEnvoy's Horn can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones.\nSell Value:   100\nBase drop rate is 2% (at 100 Discovery).\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, the speed and distance of some attacks have been increased and the recovery time has been reduced.  While the poise damage of Hammers has been reduced, Poise damage when attacking with two-handed Hammers has been increased.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
