CONTEXT
\nPaintings in Elden Ring are Info Items scattered all around The Lands Between that act as a form of treasure hunt. The Wandering Artist Spirit's Paintings depict specific locations you'll have to find in order to meet the spirits of the artists themselves. Upon finding and inspecting one of the seven drawings, a ghost of the artist will manifest at the location from which they were painted, granting a specific reward. Note that the location you must seek is not the structure or landscape depicted itself, but rather the spot the artist would have been when painting it. This page covers a full list of all the Paintings found in Elden Ring, including their location, solution, and rewards.\n\nElden Ring Paintings Guide\n\nPainting\nLocation\nSolution/Artist's Location\nReward\n\nHoming Instinct Painting\nArtist's Shack (Limgrave)\nNorthwest of the Seaside Ruins Site of Grace, south of the Dragon-Burnt Ruins\nIncantation Scarab\n\nFlightless Bird Painting\nLeyndell, Royal Capital\nAt the edge of the cliff south-southeast of the Windmill Heights Site of Grace\nFire's Deadly Sin\n\nResurrection Painting\nArtist's Shack (Liurnia of the Lakes)\nIn the graveyard southeast of the Behind Caria Manor Site of Grace\nJuvenile Scholar CapJuvenile Scholar RobeLarval Tear\n\nProphecy Painting\nStormveil Castle\nBehind the Church of Pilgrimage\nWarhawk Ashes\n\nChampion's Song Painting\nShaded Castle\nSouthwest of the Rampartside Path Site of Grace, up on this cliff you fight Ancient Dragon Lansseax\nHarp Bow\n\nRedmane Painting\nSellia, Town of Sorcery\nNortheast of Fort Faroth, on the lower cliffs southeast of the Minor Erdtree (Dragonbarrow)\nAsh of War: Rain of Arrows\n\nSorcerer Painting\nCastle Sol\nSouthwest of Castle Sol, on the side of a bridge northwest of the Stargazer's Ruins\nGreathood\n\n
