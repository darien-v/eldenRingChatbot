[Map Link]\nRoyal Knight Loretta Combat information\n\nHealth: 4,214 HP \nDefense: 107\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nImmune to critical attacks. Breaking its stance or parrying it will only stun it briefly\nDamage: Standard, Strike, Pierce, Magic\nDrops 10,000, Loretta's Greatbow, Ash of War: Loretta's Slash\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 40\nLightning: 0\nHoly: 20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it.

Learn one or two of her attacks that you can consistently dodge and punish, and you'll be able to reliably stagger her. Use these staggers to get in more charged heavy attacks.\nBox Her In: Try to draw Loretta over to the confined area up the stairs to the left as you enter the arena. The central edifice can be used for cover against attacks, especially when healing. Meanwhile, Loretta's movement will be limited which will help keep her at melee range.\nIncom-parry-ble: Loretta's parry timings are relatively easy to learn, especially for her Leap Attack which you can bait out by maintaining a medium distance from her when dodging her spells. Although you can't get in a critical hit after a parry, you can use that time to get in plenty of damage.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nKeep Your Distance: There's no need to spend any more time near Loretta than absolutely necessary as a ranged user. Once you're far away, you're safe from most of her melee attacks and you'll have time to get in attacks while she's casting Glintblade Phalanx or repositioning herself.\n\nRoyal Knight Loretta Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSide Swing\nSwings her sickle in various directions, usually on her right flank\nRolling into her horizontal sweeps and under her diagonal swings will usually position you towards the front or back of the horse, which will give you a chance to get in a hit before the next attack or during a Glintblade Phalanx\n\nStab\nStabs the blade of her sickle in various directions\nRoll perpendicular to the direction of the sickle\n\nRearing Swing\nRears up, then slams her sickle down diagonally to her right\nGet in a hit while the horse is rearing, then roll to your right to avoid the swing\n\nBash Swing\nHer steed steps back and to her left, then bashes its head forward as she swings her sickle clockwise\nRoll towards her right flank when the horse's right hoof rises from the ground to move through the bash and avoid the swing\n\nHoof Attack\nHer steed rears up, then slams down its hooves\nGet in a hit while the horse is rearing, then roll to either side\n\nKick\nHer steed's tail rises briefly before it lashes out with its hind legs. Only used if you're behind her horse\nRoll in any direction as soon as you notice the attack\n\nLeap Attack\nJumps towards you and swings her sickle clockwise as she lands. Usually uses this when you're a medium distance away\nRoll in the direction she's moving to minimize the chance the halberd will hit you and position yourself to attack after she lands\n\nLeap Duo\nSwings her sickle counterclockwise and jumps forward as she finishes the swing, then swings clockwise as she lands, finally turning 90° counterclockwise. Only used below 80% HP. Only the second swing is parriable\nRoll away to avoid both swings\n\nGlintblade Phalanx\nHer polearm glows blue as she swings it around her head and summons 5 glintblades which fly at you after a short delay. May leap back while casting if you're closePhase 2: Summons 3 additional glintblades that fire shortly after the first set\nKeep moving around her and the glintblades will miss you, especially if you're further away. Don't try to attack until they're gone. You may be able to get in a hit when she begins to summon the glintblades, but be prepared for her to quickly combo into another attack\n\nGlintstone Star\nFires a single magical projectile from the butt of her sickle. May leap back while casting if you're closePhase 2: Fires 5 projectiles instead\nIf you're far away, circle her and the projectiles will miss you. If you're close, roll forward through them\n\nPhase 2\n\nPhase Transition\nOnce she's below 50% health, raises her shield above her head and creates a large seal of the Carian royal family\nThis move doesn't do damage, so keep track of her health and be prepared to take advantage of this to get in free damage\n\nLoretta's Greatbow\nSummons a magical greatbow, pulls back a giant magical arrow, and shoots it. The arrow explodes on impact and deals immense damage. May leap back while casting if you're close\nRoll directly towards her once you see the arrow in flight. If she jumps while firing, you can dodge just by running towards her\n\n: Attack can be parried     : Attack can be spell parried\nRoyal Knight Loretta Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThis version of Loretta appears to be a spiritual guardian, protecting Ranni from trespassers. Due to her status as a former Carian Knight, it’s safe to assume so.\nLoretta is the second character in a Souls game with this name; the other being Greirat's deceased companion from DS3.\nAccording to the item description of the Silver Mirrorshield, Loretta is rumored to be an Albinauric, but she bleeds red blood when the player fights her true form, Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree, in Miquella's Haligtree.\nThe water arena she fights in is similar in appearance to a Liquid Mirror Telescope, which is fitting with the location's name as the "Royal Moongazing Grounds." However, the lack of moving parts and use of water instead of liquid metal leaves the validity of this idea in question.\nKnown as Guard Loretta in 1.00 version of the game.\n\nRoyal Knight Loretta Combo Chart\n\nRoyal Knight Loretta Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
