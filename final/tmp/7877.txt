The Halo Scythe scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for hybrid Faith based fighters. \n\nWar scythe of the Cleanrot Knights who fought alongside Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\nThis was the weapon of commanders in Malenia's army, and the half-halo blade deals holy damage.\n\nWhere to Find Halo Scythe in Elden Ring\nThe Halo Sycthe weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nDrops from Scythe-wielding Lesser Cleanrot Knights just south of the Heart of Aeonia near Commander O'Neil (rare drop) [Map Link]\nThere are two different types of Cleanrot Knights near the Heart of Aeonia. Some use spears, and some use scythes. This is only dropped by the scythe-wielders. \nDrops from the Scythe-wielding Lesser Cleanrot Knight in Elphael Brace of the Haligtree.\n\nElden Ring Halo Scythe Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Miquella's Ring of Light\n\nYour character swings the scythe from left to right, releasing a horizontal wheel or halo of light, which hovers in place for a moment before shooting forward.\nThe halo deals holy damage and scales only with faith.\nYou can chain cast the halos as long as you have FP and stamina.\nThe halos will not track down moving enemies once the projectile has reached full speed. Tracking is however effective during the initiation of the skill, prior to acceleration, even at point blank range.\n\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War or Buffed. \nThe Halo Scythe can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nWhile the Ash of War has a lengthy wind-up and a delayed projectile, the weapon portion (after the 1.07 buff) connects with enemies, providing additional damage - about 55% of a light attack - and Blood loss Buildup at close range.\nCauses Blood loss Buildup:  (55).\nSell Value:   200\nAnti-block: ignores 50% damage negation from blocks, heavy- and charge attacks ignore more\nBase drop rate is 2% (at 100 Discovery).\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, the speed of some attacks has been increased and the recovery time has been reduced.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
