CONTEXT
\n\n Nepheli Loux, Warrior \n\nLocation\nStormveil Castle\n\nRole\nQuest NPC and Summon\n\nVoiced by\nCara Theobold\n\nNepheli Loux, Warrior is an NPC in Elden Ring. Nepheli Loux is a warrior and fellow tarnished who was ordered by decree from her adoptive father to kill and dethrone Godrick. She wears clothing similar to the starting Hero class, and she can help you in the battle against Godrick the Grafted if summoned. Her summoning sign is golden and is just outside the boss fog. Other NPC Summon opportunities include boss fights against Godfrey, First Elden Lord and Omenkiller (in Village of the Albinaurics). Progress in her questline to have her summon sign available for these encounters. \n\nThe puppet of Nepheli Loux can be summoned for aid in battle by using the Nepheli Loux Puppet Ashes.\n\nLet the scars I carve remind them.   \nI am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.\n\nNepheli Loux Location in Elden Ring\nNepheli Loux can initially be found at Stormveil Castle, inside a room before reaching the Secluded Cell site of grace. [Map link]\n\nWhile outside Roundtable Hold, she can be attacked and drops Stormhawk Axe when defeated. \nHer adoptive father is Gideon Ofnir, leader of Roundtable Hold. Her real father might be Godfrey, First Elden Lord.\nAfter defeating Godrick the Grafted and exhausting the initial dialog with Gideon Ofnir at Roundtable Hold, you can find her in the room outside the library.\nAfter exhausting her dialogue at Roundtable Hold, you can find her under the stone bridge leading up to the Village Of The Albinaurics. [Map link]\nAfter defeating Omenkiller, Nepheli will return to Roundtable Hold, crouching near the bottom of the stairs next to the blacksmith.\nNepheli questline point of failure: If the player speaks to Melina at the Forge of Giants site of grace (triggering the cutscene with the Roundtable Hold) before finishing Nepheli's dialogue and defeating Omenkiller at the Village of the Albinaurics, then she will disappear for good. Her Stormhawk Axes drop at the village and the questline ends. To avoid this failure, defeat Omenkiller and finish her dialogue before resting at the Forge of Giants.\nNepheli questline point of failure: if you do not give Nepheli the Stormhawk King key item at roundtable hold before you defeat Maliketh, she leaves and her questline cannot be completed. Once you unlock Ashen Capital she disappears from the roundtable hold, and her questline is locked out for the playthrough.\n\nNepheli Loux Questline: How to complete Nepheli Loux's Quest\nHer Father's Orders\n\nFind Nepheli inside the room to the north of the heavily guarded Stormveil Castle courtyard.\nExhaust her dialogue so that she offers her help in fighting Godrick the Grafted.\n(Optional) Before you go through the gold fog door, there is a summoning sign next to it that you can use to summon Nepheli. \n\nRegardless if you are playing online or offline, you can still use her summoning sign.\n\nAfter defeating Godrick, she moves to the room outside the library in Roundtable Hold. Speak to her and exhaust her dialogue.  \n\nShe won't move here if you didn't talk to Gideon Ofnir at all yet. Talk to him and reload at the site of grace and she will appear.\nYou must also rest at the Godrick the Grafted site of grace for her to appear at the Hold.\nShe'll then reward you with the Arsenal Charm.\n\n Seluvis's Potion\n\nFinish her quest above, or skip it. Either way this quest will be doable. You must meet her at the Roundtable Hold once. \n\nNote: If you offer her Seluvis's potion when meeting her in the Roundtable Hold the first time, she will refuse to take it. Once she returns to the Roundtable Hold from the Village of the Albinaurics, you can offer it again by speaking to Gideon about her despair.\n\nSpeak to Preceptor Seluvis and receive the quest. \n\nIf Seluvis is dead, you can continue on with the quest starting from the next step.\n\nFind Nepheli at the Village Of The Albinaurics, exhaust her dialogue, and defeat the elite enemy Omenkiller which can be found on the other side of the bridge above her.\nReturn to the Roundtable Hold and find Nepheli downstairs, next to the first fog wall. Speak to her.\nSpeak to Gideon Ofnir and ask him about Nepheli. \n\nIf the player has the potion, he will offer you a choice: either give him the potion so that he can dispose of it, or give it to Nepheli. If it is given to Nepheli, she will become unresponsive and leave. She can then be found in Seluvis's secret room, turned into a puppet. \n\nAlternatively, the potion can be given to Dung Eater when he is encountered in Roundtable Hold after obtaining a Seedbed Curse. This will allow you to obtain the Dung Eater Puppet summon later. Note that doing so will end Dung Eater's questline and prevent you from getting the Blessing of Despair ending.\nAfterward, you can return to Preceptor Seluvis to complete his portion of the quest.\n\nIf the player does not have the potion, the quest progresses along the line where Nepheli does not take the potion. \n\nThis happens if Seluvis is dead and the player found Nepheli at the Albinauric Village and killed the Omen Killer having never received the quest from Seluvis. This can still happen if Seluvis is still alive.\n\nThe Stormhawk King found in the Chapel of Anticipation can be given to Nepheli in Roundtable Hold, provided she did not take Seluvis's Potion. This is required for the quest to progress.\nRoderika's questline must be progressed to the point where she can upgrade spirit ashes, before you can give Nepheli the Stormhawk King ashes.\n\nLord of Limgrave\n\nAfter completing the quest above by not giving Nepheli Seluvis's Potion, you must progress Kenneth Haight's quest to the point where he's in Fort Haight saying he has to look for a fitting lord to rule Limgrave.\nAfter defeating Morgott and (optionally) talking to Gideon about helping Nepheli get back on her feet, you can find Nepheli, Kenneth, and Gostoc in the Stormveil Castle throne room near the Godrick the Grafted site of grace. If they do not appear, spawn from the Godrick the Grafted site of grace and rest at the Secluded Cell site of grace (do not merely teleport to it), which may fix the issue. (If this doesn't work, try the same in reverse: travel to Secluded Cell and rest there, then run to Godrick and rest again there. Also, you can try going back to Fort Haight, where Kenneth Haight usually stands, which might trigger him and Nepheli to move to the throne room.) \n\nThe quest will still advance if either Kenneth or Gostoc is dead. They are not required for Nepheli to move to the throne room.\nWarning: Killing Gideon prevents this dialogue and results in Nepheli dying where she is at the time, leaving her items behind.\nIf all requirements have been met and the NPCs have still not moved to Godrick's throne room, rest at the Godrick the Grafted site of grace.\nIf none of the above works, you still need to talk to Nepheli downstairs at Roundtable hold and give her the Stormhawk King.\nRewards: Nepheli will give the player an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone at the end of her questline. She can also be summoned for the fight with Godfrey, First Elden Lord in Leyndell, Ashen Capital.\nAn additional Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone will be sold by Gatekeeper Gostoc for 20,000 Runes. (Not applicable to his bell bearing if he was killed.)\n\nDialogue: Nepheli Loux\nIntroduction\n\n"Be proud. You were a fine warrior.Your only mistake was your choice of master.Let the winds lift you, to a higher place."\n\nWhen attacked\n\nI see. You are but a simple villain. Let the scars remind you; this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux!\n(On player kill) You wouldn't even register as a threat to father. Hurry up and die.\n\nWhen killed\n\nFather... I am slain. Please...become Elden Lord...\n\nSpeaking to Nepheli\n\n"Well, who do we have here?Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot.I am Nepehli Loux.. Tarnished and warrior, like you.I'm here by decree of my father.How utterly repellant this is...This "grafting" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord.He's tainted the very winds."\n"If you intend to challenge Godrick,I ask you call upon me.The winds run could with his deeds.I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight."\n\nSmall Talk\n\n"Apologies, but I've idled long enough.As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance. Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.\n\nAt the Roundtable\n\n"You again...I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.You defeated him. You should have it. Make good use of it. I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses."[Hands you x1 Arsenal Charm]\n"Ah yes. I wonder if you've met my foster father?He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there.If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.Father is the leader of the Roundtable.I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while."\n"It's about time I headed off.I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it."\n\nAt the Village of the Albinaurics\n\nOh, it's you... Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.A waking nightmare, made by men.\nBut this time, I'm a woman grown.And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice.Justice to the oppressors.Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux, Warrior.\n\nAt the Roundtable Hold after defeating the boss of the Village of the Albinaurics\n\nAh, you... Please, leave me be. It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think.\n(After speaking to Gideon)...So you know already, do you? Right. It's true. My father cast me out.For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns.Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.And yet I... Though it was not my intent... I betrayed him...\nI...can no longer trust in father... To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy... Where is the justice he purports, in that? He once told me that if he became Elden Lord, he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.Was he simply lying to me?\nNo, no, no... How could I say that? Father has always given me his guidance... And now...I've lost it...\n\nAfter giving her the Stormhawk King\n\n"In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm.It reminds me of my first hawk."\nI'm... not like Roderika. I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them.Still, this ash... It reminds me of my first hawk. Thank you\n\n At Stormveil Castle throne room\n\n"It's been some time. I must thank you, for your aid.I told father I would be with him no longer.I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago.This land is much like the one from which I hail.I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds."\n"Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath.Though I have now abandoned my former guidance.I cannot express how much you've helped me.[Hands you x1 Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone]Should you become Elden Lord. I would gladly lighten your burden."\n"Farewell, fellow warrior. I will remain, to summon the storm.But your guidance, and your fight... Surely lie elsewhere."\n\nNepheli Loux Notes & Trivia\n\nDepending on quest progression, Nepheli can be summoned for the fights against Godrick the Grafted, Omenkiller, and Godfrey, First Elden Lord.\nIn combat, she wields a pair of Stormhawk Axes.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n

QUESTION
Why does Nepheli Loux betray her father and what consequences does it have on her questline in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Nepheli Loux betrays her father due to his orders causing tragedy, leading her questline to a point where she questions his justice, culminating in her despair and turning into a puppet, or a tragic end if players give her the potion or fail to address key questline requirements.
