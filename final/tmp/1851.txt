Consider fighting him on the outer edges of the arena as the center has uneven terrain which can cause his meteorites to impact with the ground near you, dealing splash damage.\nAlabaster Lord has three main attack patterns: Meteorite, Slice and Dice, and Lightning Orb. He will rarely diverge from these attacks. Meteorite has a very long animation and should be exploited. After he plunges his sword from the ground, you can try and get behind him for one or two hits. The meteors don't track very well at melee range and they are unlikely to hit you this way. His Lightning Orb attack comes out very quickly, has very good tracking and requires precise timing to dodge. His Slice and Dice move begins with a diagonal dash to his left as he slashes upwards followed by a large, sweeping slash in the opposite direction. Dodging through the first slash towards his right side should prevent the second slash from hitting you and will position you behind him for a quick counter. \nOverall, his Meteorite and Slice and Dice moves are his most punishable for melee players.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nRanged players have the added advantage of being completely out of range of his sword plunge into Meteorite summon. Do note that he will sometimes charge towards you before he performs the plunge but the AoE is easy enough to avoid. The meteorites themselves have a slow travel speed and ranged/magic users should take this time to get a few hits in while they get ready to sidestep the projectiles. If you maintain your distance, the first slash of his Slice and Dice attack should land nowhere near you. However, this also makes you an easier target for the second slash. Try to dodge diagonally to the right after you see the first slash and then punish his recovery time accordingly.\n\nAlabaster Lord Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\n Meteorite\nAlabaster Lord plunges his sword into the ground, sending a shockwave out in a small radius around him. A blackhole then forms above him where several meteorites emerge and fly towards his target. These projectiles explode on impact and leave a burning effect on the ground for a few seconds. The lower his HP is, the more meteorites he unleashes at once.\nDodge the plunge attack precisely and get behind him. Alternatively, maintain your distance and sidestep the incoming meteorites.\n\nLightning Orb\nAlabaster Lord forms an orb of void and lightning in his left hand and fires it at his target.\nThis move has very good tracking and requires precision timing to dodge. Dodge to the side or through the orb.\n\nSlice and Dice\nAlabaster Lord dashes diagonally to his left as he slashes upward with his sword. He quickly follows up with a downward slash in the other direction as he changes direction himself.\nDodge through the first slash towards his right shoulder to get behind him and counter as he misses the second slash. For ranged, watch out for the first slash and then anticipate the second slash and dodge diagonally forward and to the right.\n\nAlabaster Lord Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: ??\nThe Alabaster Lords are a race of ancients with skin of stone who were said to have risen to life when a meteor struck long ago.\nOne of the Alabaster Lords became a mentor of General Radahn and taught him Gravity Magic, and Collapsing Stars, Gravity Well and Rock Sling are three of the gravitational techniques studied by the young Radahn.\nOther Notes and Trivia Go Here\n\nDialogue\n\nThis boss has no dialogue\n\nAlabaster Lord Image Gallery\n[screenshots and artwork go here]\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
