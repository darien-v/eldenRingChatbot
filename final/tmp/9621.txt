After discarding the weapon and reloading your location, the weapon would reappear at its original location provided that Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy was still alive.\nIf the player manages to beat Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy without picking up the Serpent-Hunter, the weapon disappears.\nVideo Location\n\nElden Ring Serpent-Hunter Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Great-Serpent Hunt\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nSerpent-Hunter can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nA solid weapon for Strength build due to its A scaling for Strength. While slightly heavier than the Lance and cannot be infused with Ashes of War, the Serpent-Hunter has a horizontal sweep as its strong attacks. It can also be used as an offhand weapon for the Lance if one wants to dual wield Great Spear class weapons.\nAt 80 Strength and 12 Dexterity, the Serpent-Hunter has 694 AR when one-handed and 747 AR when two-handed.\nSell Value:   0 \n\nThis item cannot be sold.\nThis item cannot be dropped and given to another player.\n\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08 incorrect physical attack values of some attacks of the Serpent-Hunter weapon have been fixed.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

The same applies to the incantation Flame, Grant me Strength.\nWinged Sword Insignia does not trigger while attacking, but does receive the benefit if triggered by another weapon.\nWhen dual wielding with another Great Spear class weapon, both spears will generate the beams during the powerstance attacks.\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Serpent-Hunter\n\nGreat Spears Breakdown\n\nSerpent-Hunter PvP Poise Damage Values in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations.
