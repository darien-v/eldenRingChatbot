CONTEXT
\nCrafting in Elden Ring allows players to create their own Ammunition and Consumables using Materials from the Lands Between's environment, Enemies, and Creatures. This page covers how to craft, what can be crafted, and a table of materials.\n\nSee Cookbooks for a full list of crafting recipes.\nSee Ammunition for crafted Arrows/Bolts.\nSee Consumables for crafted consumable items.\n\nHow to Craft in Elden Ring\nTo enable the crafting menu, players will need a Crafting Kit, purchasable from Merchant Kalé for  300 Runes at the Church of Elleh, Limgrave. [Map Link].\n"You know, if you can spare the runes, you should buy yourself a crafting kit. A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own. Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration." - Merchant Kalé\nOnce this is done, a new menu will appear on the user interface, allowing for the combination of items to create new consumables.\nCrafting can be done "on the fly" in any location, and items are deposited directly to your consumables inventory for quick access. Crafting more of a slotted but depleted item will automatically fill those slots as well. However, crafting is not available while in combat with an enemy.\n\nCrafting Containers in Elden Ring\nCertain crafting recipes require Containers which are returned to the inventory upon use of their respective Consumable Items.\n\n Cracked Pot\n Ritual Pot\n Perfume Bottle\n\nNew Crafting Recipes in Elden Ring\nPlayers can expand their crafting repertoire by collecting Cookbooks. There's a total of 59 cookbooks which can be found as treasures or purchased from Merchants throughout The Lands Between.\nRecipes are automatically added to the crafting menu after obtaining a cookbook. \nWhat can be Crafted in Elden Ring\n\nBeast Bone Arrows/Bolts\nMost Consumables\n\nWhat cannot be Crafted in Elden Ring\n\nKey Items\nMost Multiplayer Items\nTools\nUpgrade Materials\n\nMaterials in Elden Ring are primarily used for Crafting, often to create Ammunition and Consumables. They can be found while exploring the Lands Between, purchased from Merchants, or dropped by Enemies. This page covers their names, methods of acquisition, recommended farming Locations, and respective crafted items.\nContainers are Key Items which are essential vessels for crafting certain items, controlling the quantity you can hold at a given time.\nNote: Discovery influences your chance of obtaining items from drops. It can be raised by increasing your Arcane attribute, consuming the Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot, and/or wearing Silver Scarab talisman.\n\nAmmunition\n\nBell
