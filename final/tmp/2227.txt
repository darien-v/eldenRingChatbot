CONTEXT
\n\n Holy Damage \n\nCategory\nElemental Damage\n\nHoly Damage is one of the Damage Types in Elden Ring. It is one of the eight main Damage Types and belongs to the Elemental Damage category. Damage Types are a major part of the calculation that determines how much damage is dealt in Combat and are affected by many factors including your equipment, skills and temporary buffs.\n\nElden Ring Holy Damage Guide\nHoly Damage is a type of Elemental Damage dealt by both players and enemies alike. Holy Damage is often effective against Undead creatures and "unholy living enemies" and ineffective against Shardbearers and creatures considered Holy.\nMost Shields can be upgraded via the Sacred Upgrade Path in order to imbue them with Holy Damage properties.

For weapons that deal purely Holy Damage, there will be no buff, for example, when the player's health falls below 20% with a Red-Feathered Branchsword equipped, or when the player uses a Jump Attack with a Claw Talisman equipped. If the weapon deals split damage, the Holy Damage will not be affected, but the other damage type(s) will. If the uses a pure Holy Damage weapon with a weapon employing another damage type in a power stance, once again, only the Holy Damage will be unaffected by the buff. This does not seem to be the case for PVE. It's unclear if this disparity is intentional.\n\nDamage Types in Elden Ring\n\nCritical Damage  ♦  Fire Damage  ♦  Incant Scaling  ♦  Lightning Damage  ♦  Magic Damage  ♦  Pierce Damage  ♦  Slash Damage  ♦  Sorcery Scaling  ♦  Special Weaknesses  ♦  Standard Damage  ♦  Strike Damage\n\n

QUESTION
Why is Holy Damage often effective against Undead creatures and "unholy living enemies" but ineffective against Shardbearers and creatures considered Holy?

ANSWER
Holy Damage is often effective against Undead creatures and "unholy living enemies" because it is designed to target such entities' vulnerabilities, while being ineffective against Shardbearers and creatures considered Holy due to their resistance or immunity to this specific type of damage.
