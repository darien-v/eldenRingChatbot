CONTEXT
\n\n Dexterity \n\nType\nMain Attribute\n\nEffect\nAttribute required to wield advanced armaments.Also boosts attack power of dexterity-scaling armaments, reduces casting time of Spells, softens fall damage, and makes it harder to be knocked off your horse.\n\nDexterity is one of the Stats in Elden Ring. Stats refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. Dexterity primarily affects a player's ability to wield Dexterity-based Armaments, as well as the damage dealt by such weapons. It is one of the 8 Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on to level up, increasing the Stat's effectiveness and influencing their relative secondary stats. Stats such as Dexterity are an important aspect of character progression in Elden Ring.\n\nDexterity Elden Ring Guide\n\nDexterity (DEX) is a Main Attribute that primarily allows the wielding of Dexterity-based Armaments (Weapons). It also acts as the primary modifier that influences the damage dealt by such weapons.\nWeapons in Elden Ring have a minimum Stat requirement that needs to be met before the weapon can be wielded. Most weapons require investment in either the Dexterity or Strength stats, or a combination of both. For example, the Scimitar requires 12 DEX and 8 STR to equip. Some weapons may also require points in Intelligence, Faith or Arcane in order to wield. This is especially true for spell-based weapons such as Glintstone Staves and Sacred Seals.\nWeapons are also given a Scaling Grade denoting the degree to which they scale with an attribute. Each point allocated to the Dexterity stat increases the damage dealt by weapons with Dexterity scaling. A weapon with a Dexterity scaling grade of S will benefit the most from the Dexterity Attribute, followed by grades A, B, C, D, and E.\nNote that attributes will incur diminishing returns at higher levels, significantly reducing their benefits after a certain point with regards to weapon scaling. This is often referred to as the 'Soft Cap'. A 'Hard Cap' also exists in which additional points in an attribute returns little to no benefit.\nWhen scaling the attack power of a melee armament, like all stats, Dexterity soft caps differ depending on the weapon and the damage type being scaled. Scaling on physical damage is often 18/60/80 by default, 20/60/80 on keen affinities and some unique weapons, and 16/60/80 on quality affinities. Note that in the rare case that magic, fire, lightning, or holy scales on dexterity, the soft caps are always 20/50/80.\nWhen scaling the incantation scaling of the Frenzied Flame Seal, Dexterity soft caps are 15/30/45.\nDexterity also affects the cast speed of Sorceries and Incantations. Every point in Dexterity increases the cast speed slightly.\nDexterity also appears to impact the draw speed of bows. A previous iteration of this page also suggested it may increase arrow velocity, though this is unconfirmed. Further testing required.\nPoints in Dexterity reduces Fall Damage, as well as making it harder to get knocked off Torrent.\n\nHow to Increase Dexterity in Elden Ring?\nDexterity is one of the Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on in order to level up.\n\nThe ability to level up is unlocked shortly after meeting Melina for the first time near the beginning of the game.\nLeveling up can be done at any Site of Grace once unlocked.\nThe amount of Runes required to raise an Attribute increases with each character Level.\nRunes are obtained primarily by defeating Enemies and Bosses. Certain consumables such as the Lands Between Rune can also be used to gain a fixed number of runes.\n\nDexterity-increasing items\n\nProsthesis-Wearer Heirloom (+5)\nMillicent's Prosthesis (+5)\nRadagon's Scarseal (+3) / Radagon's Soreseal (+5)\nConsort's Mask (+1)\nOkina Mask (+3)\nImp Head Long Tongued (+2)\nFlask of Wondrous Physick - Dexterity-knot Crystal Tear (+10 while in effect)\nGodrick's Great Rune (+5 while in effect)\nOath of Vengence (+5 while in effect)\n\nDexterity Cast Speed Guide in Elden Ring\nAs previously mentioned, Dexterity affects the cast speed of Sorceries and Incantations, and putting points into dexterity slightly increases the casting speed. The noticeable difference in casting speed varies from spell to spell.\n\nAll spells have two consecutive animations, the startup animation and the casting animation. Dexterity affects the startup animation while the casting animation remains constant for all spells.\nThe length of the startup animation will slightly decrease with each point invested in Dexterity. At 0 Dexterity, you'll play the entire startup animation before the actual cast, at 35 Dexterity, you'll play 50% of the startup animation before the actual cast.\nThe cap for casting speed is at 70 Dexterity, meaning once you've invested 70 points in Dexterity, you'll skip the entire startup animation and go straight into the actual casting animation. If you go past 70 Dexterity, the casting speed won't increase anymore.\nThere are some items that provide virtual Dexterity for spellcasting. Radagon Icon grants you +30 Virtual Dexterity and Azur's Glintstone Staff grants you +40 Virtual Dexterity. These items effectively increase your casting speed if you have them equipped. This means you can achieve the max casting speed at 70 Dexterity if you have both of these items equipped and have the same effect without investing any points in Dexterity.\n\nLevel Progression for
