The first R2 is a heavy forward thrust (similar to the Lance R2), and the second is a downward diagonal slash starting from your left side. Charging these attacks will cause them to change into a two hit combo with the same basic pattern, this double tap feature excels at breaking enemy posture\nGood for Dex/Faith Builds and easy to get early. It plays like a Str/Faith weapon, except you get to focus dex for quicker cast times. Deals a ton of posture damage.\nCan be enchanted with weapon buffs, which makes it interesting for specific builds.\n\nOn Faith builds, one can double up on the Faith Scaling with Bloodflame Blade, Electrify Armament or Order's Blade. If cast using a high scaling seal, such as the Erdtree Seal at 80+ Faith, these will outperform this weapons Ash of War.\nOn an Int/Faith hybrid build it can be enchanted with Scholar's Armament to recieve the Int scaling of the staff it was enchanted with.\nKeep in mind when buffing this weapon that only the Faith or Int portion of a catalyst's scaling will be considered when applying the buff.\nUsing this weapons Ash of War will remove any weapon buffs active.\n\nSell Value:   100 Runes\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
