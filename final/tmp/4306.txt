Patches is a recurring character in From Software games, usually playing the part of a trickster. He can be found in Murkwater Cave. This is an optional boss as players do not need to defeat him to advance.\nDuring combat, when Patches reaches half health, he will surrender. If the surrender is accepted, he will open up a shop in Murkwater Cave.\n\nWell, well, well?\nThought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?\n\nLocation\nPatches can be found in various locations as players progress through the world, and as they advance his questline:\n\nHe is initially found in Murkwater Cave in Limgrave as a boss, though he will surrender partway through the fight and become a merchant.\nUpon journeying into Liurnia, he will move there, and can be found at the Scenic Isle Site of Grace.\nOnce the Altus Plateau has been reached, he will move to Mt. Gelmir, west of the First Mt. Gelmir Campsite Site of Grace.\nIf the player joins Volcano Manor, he will show up in the entrance hall.\nAfter Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy is defeated, he will move to the Shaded Castle, on the bridge leading to Elemer of the Briar.\nFinally, once Tanith has been given the Dancer's Castanets, he will move back to Murkwater Cave.\nNOTE: If Patches is not present at any of the above locations, and the player has defeated Rykard without speaking to Patches as part of Tanith’s quests, then the player may find Patches bell bearing and personal items at the Gelmir rock bridge near where he kicked you off in the past.\n\nCan be summoned to assist with Starscourge Radahn, though he will immediately leave.\nThis NPC moves\nThis NPC can be fought (Except in Volcano Manor, as combat is disabled)\nIf defeated, drops: \n\n800 Runes\nSpear+7\nLeather Armor\nLeather Gloves\nLeather Boots\nPatches' Bell Bearing\n\nShop\nIf Patches is killed during his initial fight, players will lose out on having him available as a merchant for the rest of that playthrough. However, his Bell Bearing can be given to the Twin Maiden Husks, who will then sell his items.\n\nItem Name\nItem Type\nPurchase Value\nStock\n\nGold-Pickled Fowl Foot\nConsumable\n600\n3\n\nFan Daggers\nConsumable\n160\n20\n\nMargit's Shackle\nConsumable\n5000\n1\n\nGrace Mimic\nConsumable\n100\n15\n\nGlass Shard\nConsumable\n100\n∞\n\nParrying Dagger\nWeapon\n1600\n1\n\nMissionary's Cookbook (2)\nCookbook\n800\n1\n\nStonesword Key\nKey Item\n5000\n1\n\nFestering Bloody Finger\nConsumable\n1000\n5\n\nFurlcalling Finger Remedy\nConsumable\n1000\n3\n\nGreat Arrow\nArrows and Bolts\n300\n10\n\nBallista Bolt\nArrows and Bolts\n300\n5\n\nHorse Crest Wooden Shield\nShield\n1000\n1\n\nSacrificial Twig\nConsumable\n5000\n1\n\nEstoc\nWeapon\n3000\n1\n\nQuestline\n\nPatches can be found at the end of Murkwater Cave, past the Highwayman bandits. You have to open the chest to trigger the fight. [Map Here]\nPatches will surrender after half of his health is left. Stop attacking him to accept his surrender. If you repeatedly attack him while he is trying to surrender, he will become aggressive again.\nIf you speak to Patches after accepting his surrender, he will ask if you forgive him. Your choice only affects what he says in response; he will become friendly regardless. \n\nFrom this point forward, you can attack Patches three times to make him become aggressive again. If you allow him to reduce your HP to one quarter, he will offer to spare you if you use Grovel for Mercy gesture, and teach you the Extreme Repentance gesture. If you perform it before he kills you, he will accept your surrender and become friendly again.\n\nWhether you forgive him or not, Patches invites you to come back later, at which point he will open his shop. There is a new chest there, which you can ask him about. Opening the chest will reveal a trap set up by Patches that teleports you near to Mistwood Ruins.\n\nYou can go back to the Patches and talk to him. After that you will get a Calm Down gesture.\n\nIf you have already joined Volcano Manor at this point then you will skip the next couple of locations and continue the quest at the manor.\nWhen the player reaches Liurnia, Patches will leave Murkwater Cave and set up camp at the Scenic Isle Site of Grace, which is a raised isle in the southern parts of Liurnia's swamp. [Map Link] \n\nHere, he will recommend the player allow themselves to be captured by an Abductor Virgin with unique transpositional powers, saying it will transport them to the base of the Erdtree. The Abductor Virgin is located at the bottom of the waterwheel in the middle of Raya Lucaria Academy. However, in true Patches fashion, the Abductor Virgin instead teleports you to the fiery inquisition chambers of Volcano Manor, where you cannot warp out until resting at a Site of Grace. Ironically, this does put you closer to your goal, as it is one possible method of reaching the Altus Plateau, though you will have to defeat the Abductor Virgins duo boss first.\nIf you don't already have the Calm Down gesture by this point, returning to Patches without escaping to the Altus Plateau (and thus triggering his move to Mt. Gelmir) will grant you the gesture.\n\nOnce the player sets foot in the Altus Plateau, Patches will move to Mt. Gelmir, close to the cliff west of the First Mt. Gelmir Campsite grace. There, he has left a message on the nearby stone bridge, as well as a trail of colorful Rainbow Stones to lure you to the edge of the cliff. When speaking with him, he just says that he's doing nothing suspicious at all, and will direct you towards the glowing stones. Upon following his trail of Rainbow Stones to the edge of the cliff, a cutscene will trigger in which Patches will kick you down the cliff and tell you to avoid Volcano Manor. If returned to, he will warn the player again, and teach the Calm Down gesture if it has not already been received.\n\nTo be more precise about his location: go from the message (the message is right behind the Mad Pumpkin Head) to the first glowing stone, then to the second glowing stone. Jump down to the third glowing stone and look southeast; Patches should now be in view. [Map Link]\nIt should be noted that at this point in his questline, his shop will not be open.\n\nAfter joining Volcano Manor, Patches can be found in the entrance hallway northwest of the Site of Grace. He will now be available as a merchant again.\nAfter completing one of Tanith's assassination requests, you can speak to Patches to receive the Letter to Patches. This letter designates Great Horned Tragoth as the assassination target. When you return to Patches after killing Tragoth, he will mention reporting to Tanith about the assignment. Come back to talk to him after reloading the area, and he'll begrudgingly reward you with the Magma Whip Candlestick. This MUST be done before defeating Rykard, it is lost otherwise.\nPatches will leave Volcano Manor after killing the area boss God-Devouring Serpent.\nYou can then find him incapacitated at the Shaded Castle in front of the boss room, where he will give you the Dancer's Castanets and tell you to give them to Tanith. [Map Link] \n\nIf you attack him here, he will die no matter the damage and will drop his belongings, ending the quest. This prevents the player from obtaining the Patches' Crouch gesture.\n\nHe will move back to Murkwater Cave as a boss, but will surrender almost immediately, giving the Patches' Crouch gesture.\n\nIf he doesn't show up, try reloading the area AND make sure that he has left the Shaded Castle. If Tanith has already been killed, moving to the Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy Grace [Map Link] should move Patches back to Murkwater Cave.\n\nAfter accepting his surrender, he will become friendly again, but won't reopen the shop until you reload the area.\n\nElden Ring Patches Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nThis is a Tarnished enemy: its stats and attacks work like a player character with equipped items\nClosest Site of Grace: Murkwater Cave\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nPatches Combat information\n\nHealth: 1,191 HP\nDefense: Physical 85, Magic 98, Fire 98, Lightning 81, Holy 96\nFlask charges: 2\nPoise: 4\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being parried\nDamage: Strike, Pierce\nDrops 800 \n\nIf spared: Golden Rune [1] x2, Grovel for Mercy\nIf slain (or killed later):Golden Rune [1], Spear +7, Leather Armor, Leather Gloves, Leather Boots, Patches' Bell Bearing\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 13.8\nSlash: 13.8\nStrike: 16.4\nPierce: 15.2\n\nMagic: 16.4\nFire: 16.4\nLightning: -3.1\nHoly: 17.5\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 218\nScarlet Rot: 218\nHemorrhage: 168\nFrostbite: 168\n\nSleep: 182\nMadness: 182\nDeath Blight: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n1,191\n2,805\n3,085\n3,226\n3,366\n3,646\n3,786\n3,927\n\nRunes\n800\n4,000\n4,400\n4,500\n4,800\n4,900\n5,000\n5,100\n\n Defenses \n\nPhysical\n85\n100\n102\n105\n110\n115\n120\n130\n\nMagic\n98\n115\n117\n119\n120\n122\n124\n126\n\nFire\n98\n115\n117\n119\n120\n122\n124\n126\n\nLightning\n81\n95\n97\n98\n99\n101\n102\n104\n\nHoly\n96\n113\n114\n116\n118\n120\n121\n123\n\nBoss Guide\n\nBoss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\nFight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Patches:\n\nSlow down when going against Patches to be aware of when he starts to surrender. \nAs soon as you hear the dialogue, stop your attack until you are notified "Enemy Felled"\n\nMelee Users\nAs he begins with his cloud attack, you will have enough time to circle back behind him and deliver a backstab. If successful, continue with your regular melee attacks until he stands up. Patches' attack sequence attacks are all fairly basic melee attacks that can be dodged to avoid damage or blocked. He tends to pause in between attacks so you can maximize damage in between his attacks until his HP bar is depleted to half. Then, it is recommended players slow down since Patches will soon stop his attacks and behind to cover behind his shield. Stop your attacks all together and you will still win the fight rewards and gain him as an Merchant\nMagic and Ranged Users\nWith ranged attacks, keep circling behind him, since his attacks have a limited range. It should be easy to get your attacks in especially in between his attack sequence. Just like the melee strategy suggests, slow down when the HP bar reaches mid point and attack till he retreats behind his shield.  Stop your attacks all together and you will still win the fight rewards and gain him as an NPC Merchant. \n\nAttacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nAcid Spraymist\nPatches drinks a vial and spew out an orange cloud in front of him. Getting caught in the cloud lowers your physical attack power by 15% for 1 minute.\nMove to the side or reposition as he pulls out the vial. Be aware that the cloud lingers for a few seconds.\n\nJump Attack\nPatches jumps upwards and attacks by thrusting his spear downward.\nFor this move, take a step back or block it with your shield then follow up with your own attacks.\n\nJab\nPatches performs simple thrusts with his spear, often while defending with his shield\nThis can also be blocked or avoided by rolling backwards or to the side. Players can follow up with an attack. Since Patches will often have his shield up, use this opportunity to get around him.\n\nKick\nWhile the player is guarding, Patches will kick their shield and stun them, and can perform a critical hit afterward.\nStep back or dodge out of the way. Avoid using your shield too frequently.\n\nDialogue\nDuring fight\n\nWell, well, well?Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!Cough up your coin, all of it!\n\nSurrendering (around 50% health)\n\nWait, wait, please!I surrender!

You can't harm a yielding man!\n\nProvoked\n\nCripes, are you dense, boy/sweetheart?Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.We're about to make out like Bandits, boys!\n\nDeath\n\nWell... It was bound to happen some day...What a **** show...\n\nKilling the player\n\nThere's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you.\n\nIf allowed to surrender\n\nWell, finally come around, have you?I knew you would. You're a man/lady of reason, through-and-through.Ha ha ha...[Gives two Golden Rune [1] and teaches the Grovel for Mercy gesture]\nAhhh...Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me.Now, how did I get that wrong?I took you for a demi-human, or some such.An innocent mistake, I assure you.Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on?\n\n"Forgive and forget"\n\nA true man/lady of reason. Just what I like about you.I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel.In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.So, don't be a stranger, eh? I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.Ha ha ha...\n\n"Some things can't be forgiven"\n\nSlow down, son/madame...What's the matter? This simply isn't like you.You've always known an innocent mistake when you see one.Well, suit yourself.I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel.In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.So, don't be a stranger, eh? I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.Ha ha ha...\n\nIf spoken to again before he has opened the shop\n\nDon't forget to pop back for another visit, friend.I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.\n\nAfter reloading the area\n\nWell, nice of you to drop in, finally.It's a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something.And welcome to Patches' Emporium.Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch.\n\nGreeting\n\nHello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.\n\nLeave\n\n(Without buying anything)\n\nStingy little beggar...Try to find it in your heart next time, eh?\n\n(After buying something)\n\nCheers for that.\n\nIf spoken to again after leaving\n\nForgot something on your shopping list?No, no trouble to me.\n\n"About the bandits"\n\nYeah, I had those bandits make a clean break.Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that.I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying,but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection.They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army.Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish....It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all.\n\n"That chest..."\n\nHm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest?Well, it's uh, nothing too special.Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer...But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin...And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming...Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take.\n\nSecond visit without opening chest\n\nBy the way, friend...You've really been there for me, through thick and thin.And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you.An extra-special thanks, to an extra-special customer.\n\n"What you spoke of before"\n\nWhat's wrong? I've made up my mind.The chest is yours, in word and deed.Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold.But a Patches' promise? Well, that's priceless!\n\nCutscene after opening the chest\n\n(Before bequeathing his chest to the player)\n\nWell well well?I should have known, you scheming little thief.The gods demand vengeance. Vengeance!\n\n(After bequeathing his chest to the player)\n\nHe he he he he...My sincerest gratitude. I thought I'd never wrench that thing open.You're the finest customer a man ever had!\n\nReturning after being transported\n\n(Before bequeathing his chest to the player)\n\nAh, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm?But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience.At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!\n\n(After bequeathing his chest to the player)\n\nAh, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests?No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate.At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!\n\n[Teaches the Calm Down gesture]\nBefore moving to Liurnia\n\nOh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave.I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on.No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop.They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face.Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh?\n\nMeeting in Liurnia\n\nOh, well! It's been a long while.It's me. Patches the Untethered.I'm still in business, if you can believe it.Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch.Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria.\n\n"Speaking of..."\n\nBy the way, have you met that girl Rya?She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help.Not that it's any of my business, but...If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear?\n\nTalk\n\nYou're...making your way to the Erdtree, no?Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination.Have you ever seen an iron virgin?The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels....but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition.And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.Its transpositional powers fully intact.So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...It'll chuck you straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told...Ha ha...ha ha...\n\n"What you spoke of before"\n\nOh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like.There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree.Heh heh...ha ha...\n\nAfter helping Rya\n\nOh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine...Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium!\n\nReturning after the Abductor Virgin trap\n\nWell, fancy meeting you here.Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend.I spoke no lie, not a one.You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake,but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out.I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear.But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right?[Teaches the Calm Down gesture]\n\nFinding him on Mt. Gelmir\n\nOh, erm, hello, yes.Strange place for a chance encounter, eh?Thought I could use a rest. Don't mind me, go about your business.Right, over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.Heh heh heh...\nWhat is it? Oh, don't mind me. Off you trot.Right over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.Heh heh heh...\n\nCutscene after following the Rainbow Stones\n\nWell, if you really are that gullible...Ngh!then stay away from the Volcano Manor!Bye now!Take care!\n\nReturning after being kicked down\n\nOh, my, well, here you are again.So sorry for that. I meant to warn you, but whoops! There you went.Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have.But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh.And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different!Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.[Teaches the Calm Down gesture]\nYou didn't listen last time, but I'm warning you again.Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.\n\nAfter joining Volcano Manor\n\n(If the player did not accept Rya's invitation)\n\nWell, you've joined the Manor eh?I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.All good, though. We're on the same side, now. We'll do good work together.\n\n(If the player accepted Rya's invitation)\n\nWell, you've joined the Manor eh?I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.And here I thought Rya was barking up the wrong tree...All good, though. We're on the same side, now. We'll do good work together.\n\nOh, and of course, we can do business, if you like.Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you.\n\n"About Patches"\n\nAre you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor.I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers.I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade.Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud.I've never seen a woman quite like her...\n\nAfter completing one Volcano Manor request\n\nAhh, hello, what impeccable timing.This is for you.[Gives Letter to Patches]You're new here at the Manor.But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing.Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right?Go on, break a leg, then.Heh heh...\n\n"About the previous request" (Becomes available after dying to Tragoth at least once)\n\n(If Diallos has not joined Volcano Manor)\n\nWhat's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey?Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon.We're not here to make your life easier.Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree.Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with?\n\n(If Diallos has joined Volcano Manor)\n\nWhat's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey?Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon.We're not here to make your life easier.Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree.You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with?\n\n"The request is done"\n\nYou hunted down Tragoth?Are you certain?No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed.I'll give Tanith the news.Have some rest, by all means.\n\n"What is the reward?"\n\nHmph.Sharper than you seem, aren't you...I was just holding onto it for you, you know.Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.[Gives Magma Whip Candlestick]\n\nAfter defeating Rykard\n\nNow you've gone and killed Rykard?You scheming little bastard/doxie.Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical...Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all...But for now, this Manor is finished.The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy.Heh heh...ha ha...Well, here I am. Untethered, once again.Good-bye, my friend.\n\nWhat is it?Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium?\n\nAt the Shaded Castle\n\nAh, oh, you again...A shame you had to see me like this...Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all.I should have stuck to what I know best...No matter. I know I-I can trust you.Gullible, yes, but a good soul.Make certain that Tanith gets this.[Gives Dancer's Castanets]Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape.C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.\nYou're able then?Then I can rest easy, my friend...\n\nOpening his chest in Murkwater Cave after giving the castanets to Tanith\n\nWell, well, well?Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!Cough up your coin, all of it!\n\nSurrendering\n\nHm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you?Oh, cripes, please, wait!I surrender! I surrender, I swear!\n\nIf you continue attacking him\n\nDo you even hear me? I said "surrender", loud and clear!No one likes a bull-headed brute!You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you?\n\nProvoked\n\nCripes! Are you dense, mate?What in the world has gotten into you?Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!\n\nAfter letting him surrender\n\nWell, glad to see we're on the same page.I'd never cross you, not even close.[Teaches the Patches' Crouch gesture]\nAhhh...It's been ages since I've seen you.I didn't even realise it was you.Took you for a demi-human, or some such.You know how it is, just an innocent mistake.Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual?\nHell's bells...This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be...Especially if we keep running into the likes of you......Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...\n\nAfter reloading the area\n\nWell, finally made it, eh, and just in time.For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium.Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch!\n\nCombat\n\n(First warning)\n\nNgh!What are you playing at? That bloody well hurts!\n\n(Second warning)\n\nWhat's wrong with you?It's me, Patches. Patches!Enough now, stop!\n\n(Provoked)\n\nUgh. Hard of hearing, are we?Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming!Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!\n\n(When the player's health is at one quarter)\n\nLast chance to surrender, mate.Grovel...and I'll forgive you.[Teaches the Extreme Repentance gesture]\n\n(After using Extreme Repentance)\n\nOkay, I can see you mean it.Consider it water under the bridge.A momentary lapse of judgement. "All's well", as you know.\n\n(Player kill)\n\nTry not to be so slow on the uptake, eh.\n\nReturning after he has killed the player\n\nWell, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways.Water under the bridge. Am I wrong?We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.\n\n Notes & Trivia\n\nIn combat, Patches wields a Spear and Inverted Hawk Towershield.\nWhen Patches surrenders, he is converted to an NPC and can no longer be attacked by summoned phantoms. However, Patches may still be killed by summoned players if enough damage is done to kill him outright before he reaches half health.\nThe "Cheers for that" line of dialogue spoken when the players stops interacting with him after purchasing from his emporium seems to change after completing his questline. Prior to completion, the line is spoken with a high pitched intonation and drawn out a little; afterward it is said quicker and in a lower tone, and sounds more genuine.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
