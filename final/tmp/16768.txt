The zone features on the image for the game are already different than any available in-game at the moment, and it is likely to expand on the Lore and background of the world.\nThe expansion features its own "mini logo" which is often a signal for a large content expansion, but the main driving force behind the content size speculation is the amount of time that it has taken FromSoftware to reveal that the content is in the works. \n\nRelease Date: June 21st, 2024\nPlatforms: PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S / Steam (Physical retail versions only available for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam)\nAnnouncement Date: Feb 28, 2023\nType: Paid Expansion.\nPricing: Standard Edition - 39.99 USD. Premium Bundle Edition - 49.99 USD. Physical Collector's Edition - 249.99 USD.\nContent: Speculated new areas, mechanics, equipment, weapons, NPCs, etc\n\nNew Story\nGuided by Empyrean Miquella, players are beckoned to the Land of Shadow, a place obscured by the Erdtree where the goddess Marika first set foot. In these strange new lands, players discover the dark secrets of the world as they meet others who follow in Miquella’s footsteps with ulterior motives.\n\nNew Location\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree takes players beyond the Lands Between to explore the Land of Shadow, a completely new world from Elden Ring. Players can seamlessly travel back and forth between its vast maps interspersed with diverse situations and meticulous dungeons where menacing enemies roam.\n\nNew Content\nShadow of the Erdtree adds new Weapons, equipment, weapon skills and Magic not found in the base game ELDEN RING, along with new Enemies, Boss encounters and plotlines to further increase players' RPG freedom. Take on these threats with the new powers you can acquire.\n\n
