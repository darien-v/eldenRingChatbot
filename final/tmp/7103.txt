CONTEXT
\n\n Sorceress Sellen \n\nLocation\nLimgrave, Waypoint Ruins Weeping Peninsula, Witchbane Ruins\n\nRole\nMerchant and Quest NPC\n\nVoiced By\n Kezia Burrows\n\nSorceress Sellen is a Merchant and NPC in Elden Ring. She can be found inside the Waypoint Ruins, far east from where you first arrive in Limgrave. She can teach you Sorceries. She can also be made available as an NPC Summon for specific battles.\n\nTarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here.I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly. Why are you here?\n\nSorceress Sellen Location in Elden Ring\n\nShe is found standing near a treasure chest within the Waypoint Ruins in the central-east part of Limgrave. Players can reach her after defeating the  Mad Pumpkin Head. After defeating the boss, the Site of Grace "Waypoint Ruins Cellar" appears in their boss room, allowing easy access to Sellen's services. Map Link for Waypoint Ruins.\nSorceress Sellen can also be found kept prisoner at Witchbane Ruins, however, other than speaking to her, nothing can be done with her here until progressing far enough into her quest line. Be warned, attacking Sellen here can cause issues with her availability as a merchant elsewhere and stall progression in her quest line. This can be resolved by seeking absolution at the Church of Vows. Map Link for Witchbane Ruins.\nShe can be summoned to aid in the Red Wolf of Radagon boss fight, after progressing her quest line to the point that she leaves for the Raya Lucaria Academy.\nOnce the player has progressed her quest line far enough, two new summon signs will appear at the entrance to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library, offering the player a choice between assisting her (gold sign) or challenging her (red sign).\n\nElden Ring Sorceress Sellen Shop\n\nItem Name\nItem Type\nPurchase Value\nAvailability\n\nGlintstone Pebble\nSorceries\n1,000\nAlways\n\nGlintstone Stars\nSorceries\n3,000\nAlways\n\nGlintstone Arc\nSorceries\n1,500\nAlways\n\nCrystal Barrage\nSorceries\n1,500\nAlways\n\nScholar's Armament\nSorceries\n3,000\nAlways\n\nScholar's Shield\nSorceries\n2,500\nAlways\n\nGlintblade Phalanx\nSorceries\n2,500\nRequires Royal House Scroll\n\nCarian Slicer\nSorceries\n1,500\nRequires Royal House Scroll\n\nGreat Glintstone Shard\nSorceries\n2,000\nRequires Academy Scroll\n\nSwift Glintstone Shard\nSorceries\n600\nRequires Academy Scroll\n\nGlintstone Cometshard\nSorceries\n12,000\nRequires Conspectus Scroll\n\nStar Shower\nSorceries\n10,000\nRequires Conspectus Scroll\n\nShard Spiral\nSorceries\n8,000\nAfter siding with her at the end of her questline\n\n You can choose among the following options while talking to Sorceress Sellen:\n\nStudy sorcery: Learn a sorcery from Sellen in exchange for Runes.\nGive a scroll: Give Sellen a sorcery scroll key item to add the sorceries contained within it to Sellen's merchant inventory.\nGive letter of introduction: After receiving the Letter of Introduction from Preceptor Seluvis, you can then speak with Sellen about it. She will inform you that General Radahn must be defeated in order to restore the movement of the stars, which will reveal a way to access the lost city of Nokron.\n\nSorceress Sellen Questline: How to complete Sorceress Sellen's Quest\n\nSellen can first be encountered at the Waypoint Ruins, after defeating the Mad Pumpkin Head guarding her room. She will introduce herself as the Graven Witch. Should you accept her offer to study sorceries under her, you will be able to pursue her quest line. Learning enough sorceries from her will unlock more dialogue from her.\n(optional) Progress Ranni's quest until you're asked to find Blaidd in Siofra River.  He will ask you to question Seluvis for information, who will direct you to Sellen for that information.\nFind Primeval Sorcerer Azur north of Hermit Village on Mt. Gelmir, you will need to circle all around the volcano to find him [Map Link] He will give you the sorcery Comet Azur upon interacting with him.\n\nGo back and speak with Sellen. She will give you a special glinstone key and task you with finding the sorcerer Master Lusat.\n(this step can be done now or skipped and left until the very end of the questline) Go to Caelid and find the secret cave Sellia Hideaway, hidden behind an invisible wall. [Map Link]. Deep inside Sellia Hideaway, at the bottom of a chasm filled with crystal ledges, you will encounter a glinstone barrier blocking access to a very small cave. Interact with the barrier to open it using Sellen's key. Inside, you will find Master Lusat. Interact with him to learn the spell Stars of Ruin. Return to Sellen and she will reward you with a Starlight Shard.\n\nReturn to Sellen after defeating Starscourge Radahn. She will request that you meet her in person at the Witchbane Ruins where she will give you Sellen's Primal Glintstone.\nIf you haven't done so yet, travel back to Redmane Castle where Witch-Hunter Jerren can be found sitting in the throne room. Speak with him and exhaust his dialogue. Afterwards, reset the area by resting at any Site of Grace. This should cause Castle Redmane to return to the enemy-filled state it was in before the Radahn Festival event began.\nReturn to Witchbane Ruins where you will find Jerren standing in the room with a now deceased Sellen. Once again, speak with Jerren and exhaust his dialogue.\nJourney to the Three Sisters area and locate the ruins on the right side of the approach up to Ranni's Rise. You must locate an illusory floor that must be struck to reveal. The location of the illusory floor is shown below.\n\nWithin this secret basement of dolls, there is an illusory wall just to the left of the glowing message that says "Seluvis's puppet. Do not touch." On the other side of the illusory wall is a room containing a doll duplicate of Sellen, where you can insert the Primal Glintstone by interacting with it. After speaking with the now revived Sellen, she will resume selling sorceries at this location until Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon is defeated.\n\nAfter completing the previous steps and defeating Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, fast travel to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library Site of Grace. Right outside the entrance should be two summon signs.\n\nThe gold summon sign offers the option to assist Sellen, where you will need to aid her in fighting Witch Hunter Jerren: \n\nDefeating Witch-Hunter Jerren will reward you with the Eccentric Set. You can then revisit the spots where you first encountered Master Azur and Master Lusat to find their armor sets (Azur's Glintstone Set and Lusat's set, respectively) laying on the ground where they once were. \nAfter the fight, you can find Sellen standing inside the Grand Library where Renalla once was, with Renalla sadly sitting off to the side of the room. Speak with Sellen and exhaust her dialogue to receive the Glintstone Kris and have the sorcery Shard Spiral added to Sellen's merchant inventory.\nSellen will remain where she stands in the Grand Library until you have completed the part of her quest line to find Master Lusat. Once that part of her quest line has been completed, reset the area. You will find that Sellen will have moved to the side of the room and transformed into a School of Graven Mages (beside of which can be found her Witch's Glintstone Crown) and Rennala will have returned to her original position in the center of the room. Despite Sellen's "condition," you can still purchase sorceries from her at any time by speaking with her.\n\nThe red summon sign offers the option to challenge Sellen, where you will need to aid Witch Hunter Jerren in defeating Sellen: \n\nDefeating Sellen will reward you with the Witch's Glintstone Crown and Sellen's Bell Bearing.\nJerren can be found afterwards, standing just outside the entrance to the Grand Library. Speak to him and he will reward you with an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nAt this point, Jerren can still be killed in order to obtain the his armor set, the Eccentric Set.\nIf you choose this option and kill Sellen, you will not be able to get the Lusat Set and Azur Set until your next game cycle.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Sorceress Sellen\nIntroduction\n\nTarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here.I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly. Why are you here?\n\nWhen attacked\n\nWhat's the meaning of this? How unfortunate. <disappears>\nYou sadden me, my apprentice.\n(On player kill) For a time, I believed us kindred spirits. My apprentice...\n\nAfter you say you want to learn sorcery\n\nAhh, a yen for glintstone sorceries? Well, your aptitude does appear...passable. But one must choose one's masters wisely.I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria, as a reviled, apostate witch. Do you still wish to learn from me?\n\nI still want to learn\n\nWell, you are a piece of work. Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery. But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.[Nod in Thought Gesture received]\n\nVisit\n\nYoung apprentice, first things first. You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance. Now, shall we start learning?\n\n§\nAfter buying some sorceries  ( \n 日本語) \n\nOur powers draw upon the powers embedded in glintstone,\n\nbut what is the nature of such power?\n\nGlintstone is the amber of the cosmos, \n\ngolden amber contains the remnants of ancient life and houses its vitality,\n\nwhile Glintstone contains residual life.\n\nAnd thus, the vitality of the stars. \n\nIt should not be forgotten that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars and the life therein.\n\nGiving her the Royal House Scroll\n\nOh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days. Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar. I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons. Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.\n\nWhile imprisoned at Witchbane Ruins\n\nIt will do no good, I swear it...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates...A...argh!\n\n§Showing Seluvis'... Letter of Introduction～ \n   「 \n   セルブスの紹介状」 \n\nWell, well... \n\nSeluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again... \n\nBut, fine. \n\nIf it will help you, my apprentice, \n\nI offer my knowledge. \n\nThe stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. \n\nAnd the fate of your mistress, Ranni. \n\nBut long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, \n\nand in a crushing victory, \n\narrested their cycles. \n\nNow, he is the force that repulses the stars. \n\nIf General Radahn were to die, \n\nthe stars would resume their movement. \n\nAnd so, too, would Ranni's destiny.\n\nSeluvis' Letter of Introduction\n\nShow Azur's sorcery\n\nAh, then you have seen Master Azur. Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher. A stern judge of men, but he must have seen something in you. You make us both proud. We can speak more later, my apprentice.\n\n§Tell me your story\n\nIf you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria. It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care. I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos. No matter what we give in return. My apprentice. I presume nothing. Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path. But hear me out, my apprentice. I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?\n(Let's journey together) Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit. You must have a fabulous teacher.\n\nI have a favour to ask\n\nI need your help, my apprentice. Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer. And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere. My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat? With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.\nI need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery. He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...\n\nLead on Lusat\n\nAfter his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home. A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds. Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer. It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby.\n\nAfter meeting Master Lusat\n\nMy apprentice. Give me a moment later. I have a favour to ask.\nWho could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...You have my gratitude. This is all your work. I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit. This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.\nThis brings us a full step closer. The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy. If only I could undo these wretched shackles...\n\nAbout the request\n\nThe form you see before you is merely a projection. My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved. My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between, imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum. Can you make the journey to my body? I have something that I can only trust with you. \n\nAt Witchbane Ruins (after hearing about her request)\n\nMy apprentice, thank you for coming. These shackles take a toll on us all. There is something I need you to look after. My primal glintstone. A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver. someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you. My self.\nThank you...my apprentice... This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care.\nTreat it with care, my apprentice... What you hold is my very being...\n\nUsing Sellen's Primal Glintstone in the secret room at the Three Sisters\n\nMy apprentice, just how long has it been? Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again. And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone. Better still, I've shed those awful shackles. Finally, I can return to the academy. To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current. My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.\n\nChallenging Jerren\n\nJerren, bringer of my death.You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.But I am afraid your work is done.Join the school. To reflect on your mistake.\n\n After defeating Jerren\n\nAhh, my apprentice.You've saved my skin once again.Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?Oh, I know it's not possible.You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.But do think of me.Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.You will always be my darling pupil.Rest assured that I...No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.\nHmm. Perhaps I'm jumping ahead,but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's.(gives Glintstone Kris)Do you recall what I once told you?That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me.Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring.Next time, I will be your student.\nOh, one last thing.If you fail to claim your throne,you can always pay me a visit.Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.\n\nAfter reloading the area\n\nU...urgh. M-my...apprentice...I-I'm...\n\nOther\n\n(Subsequent Visits)There you are, my apprentice. Shall we commence the lesson?.\n(Talking again without reloading)You wish to continue the lesson? Very well, I have time aplenty.\n\nElden Ring Notes & Trivia for Sorceress Sellen\n\nYou can give Sellen the Royal House Scroll to add the sorceries Glintblade Phalanx and Carian Slicer to her merchant inventory.\nYou can give Sellen the Academy Scroll to add the sorceries Great Glintstone Shard and Swift Glintstone Shard to her merchant inventory.\nYou can give Sellen the Conspectus Scroll to add the sorceries Glintstone Cometshard and Star Shower to her merchant inventory.\nIn combat, Sellen wields a Carian Glintstone Staff and can cast Crystal Release, Shattering Crystal, Founding Rain of Stars, and Glintstone Cometshard.\nCompleting Sorceress Sellen's questline will affect the boss fight with Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing,  preventing him from casting Comet Azur.\nDespite being located in a no combat zone, the orb form Sellen transforms into at the end of her questline can be killed by the damaging roll of the Briar Set. With all 4 pieces equipped alongside the Ritual Sword Talisman at full health, each roll with deal 30 damage. She drops 1000 runes on death (base, NG) but can't be permanently killed and will respawn upon reloading the area. \n The dialogue/lore in game that suggests that Sellen was the one whom created the Graven Mages is backed up by the fact that her mentor was Master Azur, the founder of the Karolos Conspectus, whose masks are notably spared from being incorporated into any of the Spheres. The Karolos Sorcerers are also the most plentiful type encountered throughout the academy, and world in general save for places still held by Carians, where Lazuli sorcerers still reside. Furthermore, paintings of the founding sorcerers found throughout the academy (except for the ones hanging in the debate parlour) are positioned such that Lusat's and the Lazuli founder's are either on their side or upside down, whereas Azur's are positioned properly. A notable few of these are on the secret path that's before the debate parlour, the one leading to the Graven School Talisman that rests upon an inert Graven Mage (part of the world geometry; not an enemy to fight). The implication here being that Sellen had a certain level of disdain for the other conspectuses, explaining her willingness to use their sorcerers in her experiments in creating the seeds of new stars, ultimately resulting in the making of Graven Mages. \nSellen's name in the Japanese release is "セレン"/"Seren", which could be translated as Sellen or Seren; given her voice actor has a Welsh accent and the ubiquitous use of the Welsh language in Elden Ring's world, it could be that her name is in some way linked to the Welsh word "Seren", meaning "star", which would thematically align with the Glintstone sorceries she practices that draw on the power of stars.\n\nSorceress Sellen Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
