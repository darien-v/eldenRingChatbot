CONTEXT
\n\n Gowry 賢者ゴーリー「けんじゃ」 \n\nLocation\nGowry's Shack, Caelid\n\nRole\nElder Sage\n\nVoiced by\nStephen Boxer\n\nGowry is an NPC in Elden Ring. Gowry is a once great Sage who wishes to cure the young Millicent from a rotting sickness. He can be found in his shack, Gowry's Shack within Caelid. Speaking with Gowry is required to complete Millicent's questline.\n\nThe rotting sickness that afflicts  Millicent has no cure. When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood.\n\nGowry's Location in Elden Ring\nGowry can be found at Gowry's Shack located in eastern Caelid, just before reaching Sellia, Town of Sorcery. [Map Link]\n\nThis NPC does not move\nThis merchant can be fought\nIf defeated, drops: Flock's Canvas Talisman and Gowry's Bell Bearing.\n\nGowry Questline: How to complete Gowry's Quest\nHe will sell: Glintstone Stars, Night Shard, Night Maiden's Mist, and Pest Threads if unlocked during Millicent's quest.\nBeware of the Giant Dog found a short distance before the shack. Aggroing this dog and then speaking to Gowry may cause it to kill him.\nIn this location, speak to Gowry, a great sage to begin his questline involving Millicent. In exchange for yourself you can obtain Sellia's Secret. After further progressing through this questline, the sage will want to pass on some sorcery knowledge by giving you access to some of his spells. \nThe additional spell Pest Threads will become available here after progressing through Millicent's questline and giving her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis. Purchasing it from him will prompt some dialogue from him and allow you to ask him about his interest in rot and Malenia. You will also be given the Desperate Prayer gesture.\nOnce you have progressed Millicent's questline to the point that you can choose to invade Millicent or help her in battle, Gowry can be found crying in his shack. Ask him why he's crying and he will ask you to kill Millicent, rather than help her in battle, as he wishes for her to become a flower.\n\nAssist Millicent: Upon returning to his shack, Gowry will be lamenting over Millicent's decision to remove the needle. Killing him at this point will not cause him to respawn, and he will drop Flock's Canvas Talisman and Gowry's Bell Bearing.\nChallenge Millicent: Upon returning to his shack, Gowry will be dead and you can also retrieve the Flock's Canvas Talisman and Gowry's Bell Bearing.\n\nElden Ring Gowry Shop\n\nSells\nPrice\n\nGlintstone Stars\n3000\n\nNight Shard\n4000\n\nNight Maiden's Mist\n5000\n\nPest Threads\n7500\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Gowry\n\n§Introduction\n\n~\n( \n   初対面 ) \n\nOh, a pleasure to see you. a pleasure indeed. \n\nI am Gowry. \n\nA great sage, \n\nin my day anyway. \n\nI'd hoped to ask favour, \n\nwhen one of your ilk came along. \n\nA strapping young Tarnished, \n\nable to cross the Scarlet swamp of Aeonia. \n\nDon't fret, I'll provide fine recompense. \n\nShould you accept.. \n\nI will teach you the secret of Sellia, \n\nthe town you see there. \n\n[Accept]\n\nAh, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you? \n\nI need your help to heal a certain young girl. \n\nHer name is Millicent. \n\nYou will find her beyond Sellia resting at the church atop \nthe cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness.\n\nThe rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent has no cure.When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood.But Millicent's suffering can be ameliorated.For this, you are to find a certain needle.Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia, outside Sellia's bounds.The needle, made form unalloyed gold, is lost somewhere there.First you must find the unalloyed gold needle. \n\nIt's hidden somewhere deep in the scarlet swamp of Aeonia. \n\nThen I will tell you as promised. \n\nThe secret of the town of Sellia.   \n\n§After acquiring the broken Unalloyed Gold Needle ~\n【無垢金の針】入手後\n\nOhh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle. \n\nAs promised I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here. \n\nGo on, its yours. \n\nNow, let me have a look at the needle.\n\n[ \n  Sellia's Secret] \n\n§Talking with him after resting at a site of Grace, \n\nafter giving him the broken Unalloyed Gold Needle ～( 無垢金の針を直した ) \n\nThe needle is repaired. \n\nNow it will forestall the rotting sickness I'm sure. \n\nWill you give it to the girl, Millicent? \n\nI will reward you in kind. \n\nMillicent rests at the church atop the cliff, \n\nbeyond Sellia, \n\nthe town yonder. \n\nTended to by the witless pests who worship her, \n\nor rather, \n\nher rotting sickness, \n\nas a god. \n\nA wretched fate indeed. \n\nThe poor girl, \n\nshe never wished for any of this.\n\n§After giving Millicent the repaired Unalloyed Gold Needle ~Church of the Plague \n\n～ \n   ( \n   ミリセントに【無垢金の針】を渡した ) \n\nThank you kindly.\n\nFor giving the needle to Millicent.\n\nNow, she too, can begin her journey.\n\nAnd stare her fate straight in the eye.\n\nYou've been a saint, through and through.\n\nAs thanks, I vow to impart to you my knowledge of the lost sorceries of the Sellians, \n\ndescendants of the Eternal.\n\nDo you find it peculiar? \n\nThat I would show such concern for the girl? \n\nWell, I'm the one who found her. \n\nA mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia. \n\nShe is one of my dear daughters. \n\nBut the rotting sickness erodes one's memory.\n\n I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me. \n\nOh, I must be getting old. \n\nI didn't always worry so much. \n\n§After Millicent has visited, and left, Gowry's Shack \n~ \n   ( \n   ミリセントがゴーリのホロ家に訪ねて出て行って ) \n\nOh, you noticed, did you?\n\nIndeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home.\n\nIt seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, \n\nbut faintly.\n\nHowever, she has no need of me, any more.\n\nNo, she must embark on her journey, \n\nand stare her fate in the eye. \n\nI mustn't impede.\n\nAs I've aged, \n\nI've found the best way to aid the young...\n\nIs to be forgotten.\n\nPlease make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed.\n\nLike her mother, \n\nshe has the stuff to be a great warrior,\n\nbut commands only one arm, \n\nand is yet preciously young.\n\n§After giving Millicent the Valkyrie Prosthesis\n\n~ \n ( \n ミリセントに戦乙女の義手を渡した後 ) \n\nThis is a wonderful development. \n\nThank you for your kindness. \n\nNow Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential. \n\nLike her beautiful mother.\n\nGreen and undeveloped, \n\nwaiting to flower into magnificence. \n\nWhat a wondrous day that will be. \n\nIn truth, before her, \n\nI'd never seen a bud of such superior quality. \n\nShe might very well outshine her sisters.\n\n§\nAfter giving Millicent the Valkyrie Prosthesis, \n\nand purchasing the Pest Threads incantation~マレニアについて\n\nDo you have an interest in rot incantations? \n\nThen you might like to learn something of the history...\n\nof Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.\n\nQueen Marika and her King Consort Radagon \n\nwere blessed with twin demigods, \n\nand Malenia was one of them.\n\nShe was born an Empyrean, \n\ncarrying the scarlet rot.\n\nAn Empyrean...is no mere demigod.\n\nIn the age of the Elden Ring, \n\nand Queen Marika, \n\nthe precious Empyrean was born. \n\nA new god to forge a new Order.\n\nSince Malenia fought Radahn, \n\nand the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, \n\nI have dedicated myself to her.\n\nAnd to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. \n\nThe cycle of decay and rebirth.\n\n§After speaking to Millicent at the Prayer Room Site of Grace\n～( \n 祈祷室でミリセントと会話後 )　 \n\nThe words of a true innocent, \n\nthe dear girl. \n\nWell, perhaps this is just as it should be. \n\nLittle Millicent, \n\nfollowing in the steps of her mother, \n\nno matter what. \n\nThis is their fate, after all.\n\n§Once you have the choice to help Millicent; or invade her: ~Near 'Drainage Channel' site of Grace \n\n[Why are you crying?] \n\nOh it's just...\n\nI realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and...\n\nMy eyes began to well...\n\nShe is to meet them very soon. \n\nHer sisters.\n\nAnd when she does, \n\nshe'll be defeated, \n\nsurely, and begin to flower.\n\n[Become a flower? (1)] \n\nWhich is why...\n\nIf you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,\n\nI ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.\n\nIt must be done by your hand; no other.\n\nMillicent trusts you, \n\nrather deeply in fact.\n\nSever that trust. \n\nNurtured by betrayal, \n\nher bud will flower most vividly.\n\nWhen Malenia ascends to godhood, \n\nMillicent too shall be reborn.\n\nAs a scarlet valkyrie.\n\n[Become a flower? (2)] \n\nYou can't tell me you don't wish to see it.\n\nThe superior bud that is Millicent, \n\nbecoming the finest of flowers?\n\nI beg of you, kill her. \n\nWith your own two hands.\n\n§After assisting Millicent in the battle with her 4 sisters... \n\n～\n\n...and she pulls out the Unalloyed Gold Needle\n～ \n ( \n お姉妹の4人と戦いで助力上げたの後 ) \n\nMillicent, my daughter. \n\nWhy would you take out the needle? \n\nYou were so close. \n\nSo very close. \n\nTo becoming the fairest of all flowers. \n\nWould you disown us too? \n\nAs your Mother did? \n\nWe children of the scarlet rot?Millicent... Malenia... Do you detest us, so utterly?\n\nOther\n\n"We shall meet again, you and I. There are countless pests to choose from." (First time killing Gowry)\n"We shall meet again. As many times as it takes. For you to understand." (Subsequent killing at Gowry's Shack after the first)\n"Have you taken the lesson, now? Killing me is an exercise in futility. All is well, provided you understand. Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we?" (Dialogue after talking to him at Gowry's Shack after he has respawned)\n\nAfter killing Millicent at the Church of Plague\n\n"O Millicent, my daughter... Who would prune your sapling flesh?Such...such cruel and vulgar violence..."\n"O Millicent... My most promising little bud..."\n\nElden Ring Gowry Notes & Trivia\n\nKilling him at Gowry's Shack reveals the body to be a Kindred of Rot followed by dialogue from Gowry suggesting his actual body is elsewhere. When reloading the world he will have respawned.\nIf you choose to assist Millicent rather than invade her, you may be locked out of getting the Flock's Canvas Talisman. Sometimes, Gowry cannot be killed and will continue to turn into the kindred of rot. It is not known if this is intentional or a bug.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
