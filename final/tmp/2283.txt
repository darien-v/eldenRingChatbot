CONTEXT
\n\n Critical Damage (stat) \n\nEffect\nInfluences the amount of damage done by critical attacks\n\nCritical Damage is one of the Damage Types in Elden Ring. It is a special damage type that is dealt in specific situations. Damage types are a major part of the calculation that determines how much damage is dealt in Combat and are affected by many factors including your equipment, skills, and temporary buffs.\n\nElden Ring Critical Damage Guide\nCritical Damage is a special type of damage stat that can be found on all Weapons. Critical Damage is a modifier used when calculating the damage dealt by critical attacks.\nCritical attacks are powerful moves that can be performed under specific conditions. There are several situations where performing a critical attack is possible in Elden Ring:\n\nAttacking certain enemies from behind (known as a "backstab"). This deals less damage than other forms of crit.\nAttacking certain enemies in a vulnerable state due to having been parried by the player (known as a "riposte").\nAttacking certain enemies in a vulnerable state due to being afflicted with the Sleep status.\nAttacking enemies in a vulnerable state due to being dismounted from their horse. This can be performed to enemies on horseback, such as Mounted Knight and Night's Cavalry.\nAttacking certain enemies in a vulnerable state due to having their Stance broken. In the case of some large enemies and Bosses, they can be put into a vulnerable state after dealing enough damage to certain body parts, or after dealing enough damage in general.\n\nIf performed correctly, the player and the target are locked in a short animation where the player performs a highly damaging attack, often finishing off weaker enemies instantly. The animation varies by Weapon type and neither the player nor the target can be damaged by outside sources until the animation has finished.\n\nCritical Damage Invulnerability\n\nDuring a critical attack animation, the player is invulnerable to damage including Fall Damage (it is possible to avoid a lethal fall by performing critical attack on an enemy as the player falls off a ledge)\n\nCritical Damage and Weapons\nAll Weapons in Elden Ring possess the Critical Damage stat, and most can be used to perform a critical attack. This stat affects how much damage critical hits deal.\nMost weapons possess a crit damage stat of 100, with some exceptions:\n\nThe Misericorde has the highest value (140)\nThe second highest is shared between the Rapier and Dagger (130)\nMost other Daggers and Claws (110)\nExceptions within other weapon types are noted in the table below:\n\nAxes\nCurved Greatswords\nGreataxes \nGreatswords\nSpears\nStraight Swords\n Thrusting Swords\n\n (110)\nMorgott's Cursed Sword (110)\nExecutioner's Greataxe (115)\nLordsworn's Greatsword (110)\nDeath Ritual Spear (110)\nLordsworn's Straight Sword (110)\n Rogier's Rapier (110)\n\nSacred Relic Sword (110)\n\nOrnamental Straight Sword (110)\n\nNoble's Slender Sword (110)\n\nNote that weapon type also has an impact on the critical damage. For example, daggers innately deal more critical damage than other weapon types. Erdsteel Dagger does 4.4x damage on a riposte while Lordsworn's Greatsword only does 2.75x, even though both have a critical value of 110.\nHere are all the melee weapon types in descending order of critical damage with their respective riposte multipliers (assuming critical damage is 100):\n\nDaggers(4.0x)\nClaws, Fists(0.5x+3.0x)\nThrusting Swords(3.3x)\nAxes, Flails, Hammers(0.5x+2.75x)\nCurved Swords, Katanas, Straight Swords, Twinblades(3.0x)\nHalberds, Spears(2.8x)\nColossal Swords, Colossal Weapons, Curved Greatswords, Greataxes, Greathammers, Greatswords(0.5x+2.0x)\nGreat Spears, Heavy Thrusting Swords, Reapers(2.4x)\n\nWhips, ranged weapons and spell implements cannot be used for critical hits, despite displaying a critical damage stat of (100).\nIncreasing Critical Damage Done in Elden Ring\nCritical Damage can be increased by equipping the following:\n\nDagger Talisman (increases damage of critical hits by 17%)\n\nIncreasing Resistance to Critical Damage in Elden Ring\nCritical Damage dealt to the player can be reduced by equipping the following:\n\nCrucible Scale Talisman\n\nElden Ring Critical Damage Notes & Tips\n\nRipostes do a lot more damage than backstabs.\n\nThe following talismans add effects to critical attacks:\n\nAssassin's Cerulean Dagger (critical hits restore FP)\nAssassin's Crimson Dagger (critical hits restore HP)\n\nUnlike many games, critical hits are deliberately performed actions rather than a random bonus that may occur for a given attack.\nSome descriptions within the game may refer to dealing 'critical hits' instead of specifying critical damage. The above mentioned two talismans are some examples.\n\nDamage Types in Elden Ring\n\nFire Damage  ♦  Holy Damage  ♦  Incant Scaling  ♦  Lightning Damage  ♦  Magic Damage  ♦  Pierce Damage  ♦  Slash Damage  ♦  Sorcery Scaling  ♦  Special Weaknesses  ♦  Standard Damage  ♦  Strike Damage\n\n
