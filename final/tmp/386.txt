She drops the Black Knife once defeated.\nDown the lift is a Site of Grace and a fog gate that requires a Stonesword Key to open. Through the door is a Wraith Caller guarding the Crimson Seed Talisman. Head back to the main room once you've dealt with this one.\nTo the East is an exit.  On the ground a half-buried tablet shows the message "Shadow bathes in light and knows weakness."  Continue down a staircase leading down.  The second right/South exit takes you to a room, where two Wraith Callers perch at the top of a set of stairs.  A Revenant spawns out of the ground in the space under where the Wraith Callers are. There is a Ghost Glovewort [4] near its back wall.\nAt the top of the stairs behind a Grave Violet is an illusionary wall that reveals a ledge above a large hall below.\n\nThe hallway area is also accessible by taking the first right/East exit you passed earlier.  Two imps, one covered in darkness and a second standing in a light circle can be seen from the ledge.\nThis is your first hint regarding this dungeon's mechanic - you have to lead the dark covered imps (and any other 'dark' enemies) into the light to be able to damage them.  They will be staggered upon walking into it.\nThe hallway takes a turn and down some steps you come to a room with two Shadow imps and a Wraith Caller under the stairs. The light circle is down the steps to the right. \nA Grave Violet and a Grave Glovewort [4] can be found in the space under the entry to the room.\nTake the eastern exit down some stairs to the next room.  You'll notice the floor in the midst of a set of columns is sandy and has a depression in the middle that would collapse when you walk forward.  Instead, walk around the outer edge of the room to the opposite corner to grab the Leyndell Soldier Ashes from the corpse.With no other path forward, you must walk to the center of the room and trigger the floor collapse. \nYou'll fall into a circle of light, surrounded by four shadow imps. Once you have fought them off,  there is a Grave Glovewort [3] in the alcove South of the light circle as you stand facing the wooden gate.  Pull the lever next to the gate to the North. The large wooden gate opens in front of you.\nDown the stairs on the other side of the gate are three Rotting Corpses and three active Guillotine traps.  Note that further down the hall on a bridge on the second level are two more Rotting Corpses that are going to drop down as you walk below the bridge.  An additional four Rotting Corpses stood at the far end of the hall where it takes a turn right/East.\nIf you get on the second blade and ride up you can land on a platform that leads up to a staircase with four Rotting Corpses. Continue through to a room, where are five Rotting Corpses around the bottom of the steps as well as two Wraith Callers at the top of the steps.\n\nIt leads you to a room up some steps with four Rotting Corpses. The path up the stairs behind the Wraith Callers will bring you back to the room with the collapsing floor (if you accidentally fell before collecting the Leyndell Soldier Ashes, you can go grab them now).\nUnder the stairs is a space blocked off by white fog that requires a Stonesword Key door to dispel.  Behind it is a Grave Glovewort [5] and the Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +1 guarded by two more Rotting Corpses. Assuming you already have the Leyndell Soldier Ashes, return to the guillotine room. After the second trap is a Ghost Glovewort [4] followed by four additional Rotting Corpses. Two more would drop from a overhead bridge as you approach.\nAround the corner will be a mounted Wraith Caller, three more Rotting corpses, and another three guillotine traps. Beyond these is the heavy double door leading to the boss.\nBefore that, however, turn to your right/South to pick up a Grave Glovewort [3].  Climb the ladder visible in that alcove. You are now standing on ledge above a room guarded by another Revenant - see the yellow and black vapour rising from teh spot between the Grave Glovewort and the corpse. Drop down, lure it out by getting close to that spawning point and run back up the ladder to the ledge. From here, you can safely use range or the Night Maiden's Mist to kill it. Casting a healing spell while it is in range also deals damage to it.  In this room is a Human Bone Shard and a Grave Glovewort [5].  The revenant itself drops a Ghost Glovewort [4].\n\n**Note:  this Revenant respawns at the same location after some time has passed even without you resetting at the Site of Grace.   It is also possible for another to spawn while one is still in place. Beware as you return to the same room during the fight with the Grave Warden Duelist or returning there to collect items.**\nTake a right after you drop down, go west across the bridge above the first room with the guillotines.  A corpse there can be looted for 3x Root Resin. Continue up some steps to a long room.  A little way ahead is a coprse with the Prattling Pate (Let's get to it).  A shadow Grave Warden Duelist stands at the far end guarding a Ghost Glovewort [4] and Ghost Glovewort [5].\nYou must draw him out and back to the light circle, the closest one being the one you dropped onto through the broken floor.  Defeating him is required to unlock the heavy door leading to the boss. You have to be in melee range to bait his attack to make him step forward, otherwise he will retreat back down the steps leading to the illuminated circle of light.  Alternatively, equip the Shabriri's Woe talisman to easily draw his aggro and have him step into the light.\nGo back past the guillotines and to the now open door - head down the stairs.  To your right is a final Rotting Corpse and a Grave Glovewort [3].\nFinally, enter the Boss room and you will fight the Ancient Hero of Zamor. The boss drops the Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff Ashes. After the fight you can collect 2x Root Resins in the back corners of the room. Well done! \n\nElden Ring Sainted Hero's Grave Gallery and Notes\nYou need two stone sword keys to get all items in this dungeon.\n\nAll Elden Ring Locations\n\nAbandoned Cave  ♦  Academy Crystal Cave  ♦  Academy Gate Town  ♦  Aeonia Swamp  ♦  Ailing Village  ♦  Ainsel River  ♦  Ainsel River Main  ♦  Ainsel River Well  ♦  Albinauric Rise  ♦  Altus Plateau  ♦  Altus Tunnel  ♦  Apostate Derelict  ♦  Artist's Shack  ♦  Auriza Hero's Grave  ♦  Auriza Side Tomb  ♦  Bellum Church  ♦  Bellum Highway  ♦  Bestial Sanctum  ♦  Black Knife Catacombs  ♦  Boilprawn Shack  ♦  Bridge of Sacrifice  ♦  Caelem Ruins  ♦  Caelid  ♦  Caelid Catacombs  ♦  Caelid Colosseum  ♦  Caelid Waypoint Ruins  ♦  Callu Baptismal Church  ♦  Capital Outskirts  ♦  Caria Manor  ♦  Carian Study Hall  ♦  Carriage  ♦  Castle Morne  ♦  Castle Sol  ♦  Cathedral of Manus Celes  ♦  Cathedral of the Forsaken  ♦  Cave of the Forlorn  ♦  Chapel of Anticipation  ♦  Chelona's Rise  ♦  Church of Dragon Communion  ♦  Church of Elleh  ♦  Church of Inhibition  ♦  Church of Irith  ♦  Church of Pilgrimage  ♦  Church of Repose  ♦  Church of the Plague  ♦  Church of Vows  ♦  Cliffbottom Catacombs  ♦  Colosseums  ♦  Consecrated Snowfield Catacombs  ♦  Converted Fringe Tower  ♦  Converted Tower  ♦  Corpse-Stench Shack  ♦  Craftsman's Shack  ♦  Cuckoo's Evergaol  ♦  Deathtouched Catacombs  ♦  Deep Ainsel Well  ♦  Deep Siofra Well  ♦  Deeprooth Depths  ♦  Demi-Human Forest Ruins  ♦  Divine Tower of Caelid  ♦  Divine Tower of East Altus  ♦  Divine Tower of Limgrave  ♦  Divine Tower of Liurnia  ♦  Divine Tower of West Altus  ♦  Dragon-Burnt Ruins  ♦  Dragonbarrow  ♦  Dragonbarrow Cave  ♦  East Windmill Pasture  ♦  Effigies of the Martyr  ♦  Elden Throne  ♦  Eternal City  ♦  First Church of Marika  ♦  Flame Peak  ♦  Forbidden Lands  ♦  Forest Lookout Tower  ♦  Forge of the Giants  ♦  Forlorn Hound Evergaol  ♦  Forsaken Ruins  ♦  Fort Faroth  ♦  Fort Gael  ♦  Fort Haight  ♦  Fort Laiedd  ♦  Fourth Church of Marika  ♦  Frenzied Flame Proscription  ♦  Frenzied Flame Village  ♦  Frenzy-Flaming Tower  ♦  Fringefolk Hero's Grave  ♦  Gael Tunnel  ♦  Gaol Cave  ♦  Gatefront Ruins  ♦  Gelmir Hero's Grave  ♦  Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave  ♦  Golden Lineage Evergaol  ♦  Gowry's Shack  ♦  Grand Cloister  ♦  Grand Lift of Dectus  ♦  Grand Lift of Rold  ♦  Groveside Cave  ♦  Guardians' Garrison  ♦  Hallowhorn Grounds  ♦  Heretical Rise  ♦  Hermit's Shack  ♦  Hermit Merchant's Shack  ♦  Hermit Village  ♦  Hidden Path to the Haligtree  ♦  Highroad Cave  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Liurnia)  ♦  Impaler's Catacombs  ♦  Isolated Divine Tower  ♦  Isolated Merchant's Shack (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Jarburg  ♦  Kingsrealm Ruins  ♦  Lake of Rot  ♦  Lakeside Crystal Cave  ♦  Laskyar Ruins  ♦  Lenne's Rise  ♦  Leyndell Catacombs  ♦  Leyndell Colosseum  ♦  Leyndell Royal Capital  ♦  Limgrave  ♦  Limgrave Colosseum  ♦  Limgrave Tunnels  ♦  Lord Contender's Evergaol  ♦  Lunar Estate Ruins  ♦  Lux Ruins  ♦  Malefactor's Evergaol  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Caelid)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Consecrated Snowfield)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Northeast)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Southwest)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mistwood)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mountaintops East)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mt.
