CONTEXT
\n\n Hyetta \n\nLocation\n Liurnia of the LakesSubterranean Shunning-Grounds \n\nRole\nQuest NPC\n\nVoiced by\nClare Corbett\n\nLightseeker Hyetta is an NPC in Elden Ring. Hyetta is mysterious blind woman who roams the Lands Between, following the guidance of the distant light within upon eating Shabriri Grapes. She seeks to become a Finger Maiden upon reaching this “distant light.”\n\n Hello? Is someone there? My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light. \n\nHyetta Location in Elden Ring\nHyetta can be found in various locations as you progress her questline:\n\nFound near the Lake-Facing Cliffs site of grace, in Liurnia of the Lakes. [Map link] (Requires receiving Irina's Letter from Irina in the Weeping Peninsula.)\nFound on the western side of the Purified Ruins, also in Liurnia of the Lakes. [Map link]\nFound to the north of the the Gate Town Bridge site of grace, in Liurnia. [Map link]\nFound in Bellum Church, northeastern Liurnia of the Lakes. [Map link]\nFound at Frenzied Flame Proscription, far below Leyndell, Royal Capital. [Map link]\n\nThis NPC moves as you progress her questline.\nThis NPC can be fought.\nIf defeated, drops: three Frenzyflame Stone (at location #3).\nKilling Irina will prevent Hyetta from spawning.\n\nHyetta Questline: How to complete Hyetta's Quest\n\nAfter talking with Irina in Weeping Peninsula, Hyetta appears next to the Lake-Facing Cliffs site of grace in Liurnia. Hyetta says she roams the Lands Between in search of the distant light, drawn to her destiny by a guiding shine she feels in the back of her eyes when eating Shabriri Grapes. She will ask for one, and if you choose to give her one, she will reward you with the As You Wish gesture. \n\nNote: Simply talking to Irina and doing nothing in Castle Morne does not spawn Hyetta. I haven't accepted Irina's letter yet, nor have I have done anything other than retrieving the first grace in Castle Morne, and Hyetta hasn't spawned yet (Q91).\n\nHyetta can next be found a short distance west of the Purified Ruins in Liurnia (outside of the west ruined building, looking out over the lake). She asks for another Shabriri Grape, but does not offer a reward at this time. (NOTE: If she does not appear here, stop by Irina's dead body first. Doing this got her to spawn for me).\nHyetta will now be north of the Gate Town Bridge, Liurnia of the Lakes. She will ask for another Shabriri Grape, and will ask what they really are. Choose to tell her what they are (the quest cannot progress until you tell her). After reloading the area, she will have more dialogue. Exhausting her dialogue here is mandatory, as she will not change locations otherwise.\nHyetta then moves to Bellum Church in Liurnia of the Lakes. She will ask you for a Fingerprint Grape, which is found as a drop from Festering Fingerprint Vyke near the Church of Inhibition. Once given to her, she will thank you and leave.\nHyetta can be finally found at Frenzied Flame Proscription, underneath Leyndell, Royal Capital. Upon accepting the Three Fingers' flame, return to Hyetta and talk to her once more. Exhaust her dialogue, and the Frenzied Flame Seal and five Frenzyflame Stones appear on the ground, completing her questline. \n\nNote: Meeting with the Three Fingers will lock you out of all other ending choices, unless Miquella's Needle is used at Dragonlord Placidusax's arena at Crumbling Farum Azula. This removes the Frenzied Flame, and is a permanent reversal.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Hyetta\nIntroduction\n\n"Hello? Is someone there? My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light. If I might be so bold as to ask... would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me? My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see. I can't tell which way I'm supposed to go next. But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light in the back of my eyes. It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden".\n(If offered a Shabriri Grape)"Oh, many thanks to you. Now I can feel the distant light once more. You are most kind, indeed. May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you".\n\nAfter Given a Shabriri Grape at the Purified Ruins\n\nYou're not like the others who give me grapes, are you...They rest their trembling hands upon me. Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes. Their frail fingers, emaciated...Yet still, they give me the grapes. But you...seem somehow...firmer. You are most kind, indeed. May the blessings of the Fingers be upon you. \n\nAfter Given a Shabriri Grape at the Gate Town Bridge\n\nI wonder, what are Shabiri Grapes? Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing... What sight they must behold. "\n\nAfter telling her the grapes are actually human eyes\n\nN-no... that's not possible. Not all of those people...their own...so those noises I heard were...- <brief pause, gags>Sorry, I'm alright now. I apologize. You only did what I asked. I'll be fine. Think no more of it. [She begins to hurl as you walk away]\n\nAfter reloading the same area and talking to her again\n\nAh, is that you over there? I have gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you. The reason why it was eyes I had to eat. The distant light is far and frail. So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye. But with everyone's eyes together, it appears. Finally, it all makes sense. I am certain now, I will become a finger maiden.\n\nAsking for a Fingerprint Grape at Bellum Church\n\nOh hello, is that you over there? Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes? They're special grapes which only grow on those who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers. I would truly love to try one.... The distant light seems far closer than before. But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore... Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me? Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.\n\nAfter giving a Fingerprint Grape at Bellum Church\n\nOh, Oh! A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape! <chewing noises> Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns... <wordless joy> Thank you. I've composed myself again. May the blessings of the Fingers be upon you.\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart. I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden.\n\nAt Frenzied Flame Proscription\n\nAh, so you're here as well, are you? ...I realized as we've talked. I'll be a Maiden. And you... surely, a Lord. Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions. It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you. May the flame of chaos find purchase within you.\n\nAfter the Tarnished is marked by the Three Fingers\n\nAhhh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you. Could you please rest your hand upon me? Burn me with the flame, to make me your Maiden...\n\n§After touching Hyetta\n\nOh, it burns... My eyes, my eyes, they're melting... Aaargh!\n\nThank... thank you... I have touched them.\n\nThe words of the Three Fingers.\n\nAs your maiden, allow me to divine them.\n\n"All that there is came from the One Great.\n\nThen came fractures,\n\nand births,\n\nand souls.\n\nBut the Greater Will made a mistake.\n\nTorment, despair, affliction...\n\nevery sin, every curse.\n\nEvery one, born of the mistake.\n\nAnd so, what was borrowed must be returned.\n\nMelt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame.\n\nUntil all is One again."\n\nThose who gave me grapes howled without words.\n\nSaying they wished they were never born.\n\nBecome their lord.\n\nTake their torment, despair.\n\nTheir affliction.\n\nEvery sin, every curse.\n\nAnd melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos.\n\nNo more fractures...no more birth... (sighs)\n\nSmall Talk\n\nAt the Lake-Facing Cliffs site of grace : "You are most kind, indeed. May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you."\n\nAfter attacking\n\nWhat on earth? I do not wish to cause anyone harm...\n(On player kill) Oh, bless the stars. You've chosen to reconsider.\n\nUpon defeat\n\nAhh, the distant light...fades... I'm so sorry, my dears...\n\nHyetta Notes & Trivia\n\nHyetta can count as the maiden mentioned in the White Mask Varré's questline. While killing a maiden is not necessary, you can kill her to cover the Lord of Blood's Favor in blood.\nWhen found at the Frenzied-Flame Proscription, her title is now Finger Maiden Hyetta, showing that she has successfully become a Finger Maiden, albeit one of the Three Fingers'.\nIrina and Hyetta have the same face and clothing.\nHer quest can still be completed after using Miquella's Needle or completing an ending.\n\nHYETTA IMAGE GALLERY\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
