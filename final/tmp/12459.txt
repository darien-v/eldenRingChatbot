The Erdtree Seal is going to outperform it if you're trying to make a lvl 120 to 150 build or below. You need nearly 60 INT/ 60 Faith just to match and start to surpass the Erdtree Seal at 80 Faith only, which is quite a few levels. The Golden Order Seal the ultimate very high level casting seal (and shares stats needed for Prince of Death Staff for sorceries) but isn't going to work all that well at a lower level. \nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08 a bug that prevented the follow-up attack from occurring when the Black Sword Incantation was activated with a Sacred Seal in the left hand has been fixed.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
