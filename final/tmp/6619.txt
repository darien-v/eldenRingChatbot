The Marais Executioner's Sword scales primarily with Strength and Arcane and is a good Weapon for melee users who want to perform a corkscrew attack. \nInfuse the sword with energy, then fling it forwards in a corkscrew attack. The sword continuously deals damage while violently spinning. Charge the attack to increase reach and duration of the spin. \n\nStoried sword of House Marais, the family of executioners who presided over the Shaded Castle. One of the legendary armaments. Elemer of the Briar, the Bell Bearing Hunter, snatched the sword from the site of his looming execution, and furnished it with battle skills from his home of Eochaid..\n\nWhere to Find Marais Executioner's Sword\nThe Marais Executioner's Sword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nDropped by Elemer of the Briar at The Shaded Castle.

It also scales with Dexterity, instead of Strength, but has worse scaling in general even though it has C in Arcane Scaling.\nEochaid's Dancing Blade does predominantly Physical Damage, with some Magic Damage, but not a lot.\nAlthough this weapon's skill does considerable damage, it is often risky to use it against larger enemies such as bosses, due to their resistance to stuns and knockdowns. Against lighter enemies and NPC-type enemies, the skill can effectively stunlock them, dealing the full damage and knocking them down with the final hit of the spin (not the swing performed after the spin). Some larger enemies such as Banished Knights will not be stunned by the skill, but if hit by the final hit of the spin will still be knocked down, so using the skill early before they enter melee range can help to achieve this.\nOne of the 9 Legendary Armaments.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

QUESTION
How can players effectively utilize the corkscrew attack of the Marais Executioner's Sword in combat situations?

ANSWER
Charge the attack to increase reach and duration of the spin, use against lighter enemies and NPC-type enemies for stunlocking, avoid using against larger enemies like bosses due to their resistance to stuns and knockdowns.
