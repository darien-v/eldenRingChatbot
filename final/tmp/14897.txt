CONTEXT
\n\n Dung Eater \n\nLocation\n Roundtable Hold Subterannean Shunning-Grounds \n\nRole\nQuest NPC, Invader, and Summon\n\nVoiced by\n Jim Johnson\n\nDung Eater is an NPC in Elden Ring. Dung Eater is a fellow Tarnished who occupies a corpse ridden room in the Roundtable Hold.\nThe spirit of Dung Eater can be summoned for aid in battle by using Dung Eater Puppet Ashes. The Dung Eater is also available as an NPC Summon when facing Mohg, the Omen and Morgott, the Omen King. Progress in his questline and release him to be able to unlock his summon sign. He may also be encountered as an NPC Invader.\n\nI am the Dung Eater! A scourge upon the living!\n\nLocation\nDung Eater can be found at Roundtable Hold.\nIf you approach him with any Seedbed Curse in your inventory, he will give you the Sewer-Gaol Key and ask you to find his real body beneath Leyndell.\nDung Eater's real body can be found in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. From the Underground Roadside Site of Grace, head out the door, turn left, slip past the Omens and fall into the gap in the sewer grate. Head straight to the end of the tunnel, fight past three Giant Miranda Sprouts, climb up the ladder and open the locked door on the opposite wall. You will need the Sewer-Gaol Key to open this door. [Map Link]\nIf killed in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, he will drop the following:\n\nOmen Helm \nOmen Armor\nOmen Gauntlets \nOmen Greaves \nSword of Milos\n\nHe can also be found around the lake at the northeast of Leyndell Royal Capital an as an NPC Invader after releasing Dung Eater's corporeal body from his cell in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds and then reading his message at the Roundtable Hold. [Map Link]\n\nDung Eater Questline: How to complete Dung Eater's Quest\n\n[!] Please note; During the questline of Ranni the Witch, Giving Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade will cause Preceptor Seluvis to become a lifeless puppet, which effectively locks you out of further interaction in his questline (And possibly prevents you from giving Seluvis's Potion to Dung Eater).\nCan be first met at the roundtable hold. He is in the locked room past the twin maidens. You can only get to this room after you have gained access to the Altus Plateau.\nAfter showing the Dung Eater at least one Seedbed Curse, he will give you the Sewer-Gaol Key, which can be used to open his cell in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, beneath Leyndell, Royal Capital.\nThe Dung Eater can be found in his cell in the sewers and released from his prison by talking to him and telling him he's free to go. \n\nSpawn at the Underground Roadside grace \n\nLeave this room and take a left\nNow head down the corridor and jump down the open grate\nRun northwest and go past the giant poison plants and climb the ladder\nBe wary of the giant hand in this room, behind it is the Gaol door with Dung Eater inside \n\nThe giant hand will respawn when you kill them before receiving the Sewer-Gaol Key.\n\nDo not kill Dung Eater here if you want to complete his questline (Dung Eater's summon sign will then appear in-front of the fog wall to assist with Mohg, The Omen. ***Do not kill him in the moat or he will not appear for Mohg any longer.***\n\nDung Eater in his cell\n\nUpon returning to Roundtable Hold, the Dung Eater will be missing, having left a message asking you to fight him at the outer moat. [Map Link] \n\nIf doing Blackguard Big Boggart's questline, be sure to complete it before moving onto the next step, or else Big won't drop a Seedbed Curse.\nTravel to the outer moat (where Boggart moves). Boggart should be tied up. Exhaust Boggart's dialogue (talk to him twice), and kill the nearby giant crab that spawns. Walk towards the middle of the moat and Dung Eater will invade you. Defeat the Dung Eater in this invasion and he drops the Sword of Milos. \n\nNote: Boggart does not need to be alive for the invasion to happen. Instead of Big Boggart, there will be a cursed Commoner.\n\nDung Eater in the Outer Moat \n\nUpon defeating the Dung Eater at the moat he will return to Roundtable Hold. Talk to him and he will ask you to bring his real body more Seedbed Curses. His body can be found tied up in a chair in the same cell that he was released from before. \n\nAt this point, Dung Eater's summon sign for Mohg will disappear.\nYou may interact with him to give Seedbed Curses to him.\nOr alternatively you could give him Seluvis's Potion. This will allow you to get the Dung Eater Puppet summon from Seluvis. But this will end the Dung Eater quest and prevent you from getting the Blessing of Despair ending. \n\nThe exact requirements to give him the potion are somewhat unclear, you obviously have to have the potion in your inventory, but you may also have to give him one or more Seedbed Curses to change his dialogue options. It also seems that Preceptor Seluvis has to be alive and conscious (Delay giving Fingerslayer Blade to Ranni).\nTip: You can give Dung Eater Seluvis's Potion and still get the Omen Set which is typically only obtainable if have given him 5 Seedbed Curses. Just give him Seluvis's Potion while he's tied in the chair and once he passes out completely wait a moment or two and kill him. The Omen set will drop and he will still be offered as a puppet for purchase from Seluvis. However, should you leave the area or quit and reload, his body would disappear, preventing you from getting his armor set. If you chose this option the Dung Eeater's body will not be found in Seluvis's laboratory.\nIf you don't see him as a puppet for purchase at first, buy one puppet and some spells from Seluvis then go out and find another Starlight Shard. When you return to Seluvis he should now offer the Dung Eater Puppet for purchase along with progressing the Seluvis quest line. Actually summoning, or even just equipping the first puppet you chose to an available slot, and then coming back to Seluvis, may also trigger him to start selling other puppets.\n\nAfter giving the Dung Eater 5 Seedbed Curses, his quest line will be complete and you will be rewarded the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse. \n\nReload the area to find the Omen Set where he gave you the rune.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Dung Eater\nFirst Interaction while at Roundtable Hold.\n\n"Have you ever felt the curse? With your whole being, the pox upon life itself. Feared and despised by all. The Reviled blessing.Apparently not. You are but a lamb. A stranger to defilement.

Be thankful of the Hold's serenity.It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay."\n\nSpeaking to him at Roundtable Hold after collecting the first Seedbed.\n\n"No. Wait.You have felt the curse. I can smell it on you, the pox yet tender.Apparently my Seedbed is ripe and waiting.It twas a brief respite I must say.Go and unshackle my corporeal fleshTrapped in the sewer-gaol below the capital."\n\nAfter Recieving the Sewer-Gaol Key\n\n"I can kill you and defile your corpse. Then the pox will truly be your own."\n\nBefore interacting with him in the Sewer-Gaol\n\n"Let me out!

Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come..."\n\nMessage left at the Roundtable Hold\n\n"I'll defile you next. Come to the outer moat."\n\nAfter his invasion\n\n"There you are. You warded off my blessing. Despite the curse stirring within you.No one has succeeded in that before. How? I thought. Then it hit me.That you are, in fact, me. And I...am the Dung Eater. It is my flesh that must receive the blessing."\n"Give me your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.Again and again. Until it is done. Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile the Order itself.Countless, I have killed. And countless, I have defiled.

My fate was the grandest, most brilliant of them all!"\n"My corporeal flesh lies in the sewer gaol beneath the Capital.Give it your blessing.
