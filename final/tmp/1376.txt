Many of them have variations of the markings on their abdomen, and some in Nokstella, Eternal City have hardened phragmotic heads that function as a shields. In Nokstella, one may even find some Nox Swordstresses riding Giant Ants as their battle mount.\n\nElden Ring Giant Ant Locations\nWhere to Find Giant Ants:\n\nAinsel River\nNokstella, Eternal City\nDeeproot Depths \nMiquella's Haligtree\n\nElden Ring Giant Ant Drops\n\n Item \n Drop Rate \n Additional Info \n\nRunes\n100%\n 122 - 2268\n\nFormic Rock\n1.50%-8.00%*\n*Bloated Ants (queens) have higher drop rate.\n\nRune Arc\n100%*\n*Bloated Ants only\n\nNumen's Rune\n100%*\n*Bloated Ants only\n\nElden Ring Giant Ant Subtypes\n\n Appearance \nSubtype\nNotes\n\nWorker Ant\nThe typical ant variant with basic moveset, with suggested counters in parentheses:*Single bite  (backstep and attack)*Triple bite  (double backstep or roll)*Acid spray  (move sideways)*Grapple + Stab  (don't stand still in front of giant ant)\n\nWinged Ant\n Same as worker ant but with wings. Same moveset as worker ant and officer ant while on the ground. Has a few additional attacks while airborne, but is limited to a set distance hovering above ground which can be used to your advantage.Even winged ants can die from fall damage. \n\nShield-Headed Ant\n Larger ant variant with extremely large and armored head. The thick skull forms a nearly impenetrable shield and the player is advised to attack the abdomen behind the head.This ant has unique attacks and can headbutt the player if given the opportunity. This is the only known variant with a poisonous bite. This variant also possesses the normal Acid-spray attack. \n\nBloated Ant\nAn ant with an extremely bloated and enlarged abdomen. These are stationary enemies with no real way of defending themselves. Often guarded by other ants.Usually drops valuable items such as Rune Arcs and Numens Rune.These do not respawn when you die or rest at a grace.This is the only variant of the ants that has separate set of resistances. It is not as weak to fire as the other ants but can be easily killed with one arrow shot in the massive ballooned abdomen. \n\nGiant Ant Notes & Tips\n\nEach ant has different meshes for their abdomen, meaning that some ants are functionally the same, but can look slightly different.The mesh for the Bloated Ant is called “Honey,” further signifying the resemblance.\nAnts are easily staggered, even by small amounts of damage such as stepping into fire created by a Steel-Wire Torch or magic.\nGiant Ants are weak to fire and resist slash-type damage.\nThe spray attack deals Standard physical damage, but has a special 'Guard bypass rate' of -60. This means the spray attack will damage you while guarding, even with a shield at 100% physical resistance.This means you want to avoid being hit by the spray in the first place. Strafing or rolling are better options than guarding, even for shield users. The attack can also hit you multiple times and can easily drain through your health if you're not careful.\nWhen you get closer to Giant Ants, they will prioritize biting attacks. If you get even closer, you're in danger of getting grabbed (a special grapple attack where the ant will grab the player, raise them up high, and stab them with their stimger before slamming them on the ground).\nDue to the fact that they drop Formic Rocks, it seems to be implied that the acid spray is indeed formic acid, the same acid deployed by real ants.\nThe spurs (stingers) on the ants do not cause Scarlet Rot, unlike the Antspur Rapier, which is an ant's spur that has been modified and augmented by a scarlet rot fanatic, Maleigh Marais.\nSome Worker Ants are mounted by a Nox Swordstress. They can be encountered in the upper region of Nokstella, Eternal City. They have glowing purple eyes, which are believed to be caused by a sort of mind control utilized by the Nox to subdue the ant. If the player successfully initiates the Sleep Status Effect on the mounted Ant, it will eject the Nox rider from its back and proceed to attack her. One should note that the Nox Swordstress is a somewhat stronger enemy and that it might pay off to stagger/damage the Nox to help the ant kill her. These ants will also attack Silver Tears in their vicinity if they survive.\nThe Giant Ants in question have a Sleep threshold of between 130 to 140, a considerably low value. This means that it should be possible for any character to proc Sleep on them. A sleep pot will be overkill and you should be able to proc sleep with 2-3 sleepbone arrows instead. The Pulley Crossbow with sleepbone bolts is another good alternative due to it's 3-shot burst, but be aware of recoil. \nGiant ants are susceptible to status ailments Sleep, Frostbite, Blood*, and Scarlet Rot/Poison, in that order.  (Weakest to sleep and stronger against rot or poison). However, they are immune to Madness and Death Blight.*If one decides to use bleed weapons on the Giant Ants, they should keep in mind the Giant Ants are strongest against Slash-type physical damage (see the table below).\nThe various ant subtypes are references to references to different castes and species.Winged Ants are alates, mature ants that grow wings to fly off and find mates to begin new colonies.Shield-Headed Ants are likely phragmotic ants based on Turtle Ant soldiers, as they use their large and flat head to block colony entrances from invadersBloated Ants are based on Honeypot Ant repletes, who store honey and sugar in their abdomens for the colony to use. The mesh for their bloated body is named “Honey” to prove this.\n\nGiant Ant Image Gallery\n\nGiant Ant Resistance Sheet\n\nDamage type\nResistance\n\nStandard\n10%\n\nSlash\n35%   (Strong against slash)\n\nStrike\n10%\n\nPierce\n10%\n\nMagic\n0%\n\nFire\n-20%  (Weak against fire)\n\nLightning\n0%\n\n Holy \n0%\n\n The absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if an absorption is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is. \n\n Elden Ring Creatures & Enemies \n\n Abductor Virgin  ♦  Abnormal Stone Cluster  ♦  Albinauric  ♦  Albinauric Wolfback Archer  ♦  Anastasia Tarnished-Eater  ♦  Ancestral Follower  ♦  Ancestral Follower Shaman  ♦  Avionette Soldier  ♦  Azula Beastman  ♦  Baleful Shadow  ♦  Banished Knight  ♦  Basilisk  ♦  Battlemage  ♦  Bear  ♦  Blackflame Monk  ♦  Bloody Finger Nerijus  ♦  Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin  ♦  Boar  ♦  Broken Statue  ♦  Burning Slug  ♦  Celebrant  ♦  Chanting Winged Dame  ♦  Chariot  ♦  Chief Guardian Arghanthy  ♦  Clayman  ♦  Colossal Fingercreeper  ♦  Commoner  ♦  Construct  ♦  Crab  ♦  Crystal Snail  ♦  Crystal Sorcerer  ♦  Deer  ♦  Demi-Human  ♦  Demi-Human Queen  ♦  Depraved Perfumer  ♦  Direwolf  ♦  Dog  ♦  Duelist  ♦  Eagle  ♦  Edgar the Revenger  ♦  Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm  ♦  Exile Soldier  ♦  Fallen Hawks Soldier  ♦  Farum Azula Dragon  ♦  Festering Fingerprint Vyke  ♦  Fingercreeper  ♦  Fire Monk  ♦  Fire Prelate  ♦  Flame Guardian  ♦  Frenzied Villager  ♦  Giant Bat  ♦  Giant Crab  ♦  Giant Crayfish  ♦  Giant Dog  ♦  Giant Dragonfly  ♦  Giant Land Octopus  ♦  Giant Land Squirt  ♦  Giant Miranda Sprout  ♦  Giant Rat  ♦  Giant Skeletal Slime  ♦  Giant Skeleton (Spirit)  ♦  Glintstone Dragon  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer  ♦  Godrick Foot Soldier  ♦  Golem  ♦  Great Horned Tragoth  ♦  Great-Jar Warrior  ♦  Guardian  ♦  Guillemot  ♦  Haligtree Foot Soldier  ♦  Haligtree Knight  ♦  Haligtree Soldier  ♦  High Page  ♦  Highwayman  ♦  Inaba, Disciple of Okina  ♦  Inquisitor Ghiza  ♦  Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood  ♦  Kaiden Sellsword  ♦  Knight of Zamor  ♦  Land Octopus  ♦  Land Squirt  ♦  Lazuli Sorcerer  ♦  Lesser Alabaster Lord  ♦  Lesser Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Lesser Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Lesser Burial Watchdog  ♦  Lesser Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Lesser Dragonkin Soldier (Spirit)  ♦  Lesser Fingercreeper  ♦  Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)  ♦  Lesser Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Lesser Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Lesser Omenkiller  ♦  Lesser Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Lesser Runebear  ♦  Lesser Sanguine Noble  ♦  Lesser Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Lesser Wormface  ♦  Leyndell Foot Soldier  ♦  Leyndell Knight  ♦  Leyndell Soldier  ♦  Lion Guardian  ♦  Living Jar  ♦  Lone Wolf  ♦  Mad Tongue Alberich  ♦  Maleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan  ♦  Malformed Star  ♦  Man-Serpent  ♦  Mausoleum Foot Soldier  ♦  Mausoleum Knight  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier  ♦  Miner  ♦  Miranda Sprout  ♦  Misbegotten  ♦  Monstrous Crow  ♦  Mounted Knight  ♦  Nameless White Mask  ♦  Night Maiden  ♦  Noble Sorcerer  ♦  Nomad  ♦  Nox Monk  ♦  Nox Swordstress  ♦  Old Knight Istvan  ♦  Omen  ♦  Oracle Envoy  ♦  Oracle Envoy Giant  ♦  Owl  ♦  Page  ♦  Preceptor Miriam  ♦  Putrid Avatar  ♦  Putrid Corpse  ♦  Radahn Foot Soldier  ♦  Radahn Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Foot Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Knight  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier  ♦  Recusant Henricus  ♦  Redmane Knight  ♦  Revenant  ♦  Rileigh the Idle  ♦  Rotten Duelist  ♦  Scarlet Rot Zombie  ♦  School of Graven Mages  ♦  Serpent Snail  ♦  Servant of Rot  ♦  Sheep  ♦  Silver Tear  ♦  Skeletal Bandit  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman  ♦  Skeletal Slime  ♦  Skeletal Snail  ♦  Skeleton Mage  ♦  Skeletons  ♦  Slug  ♦  Soldier  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish  ♦  Spirit NPC  ♦  Springhare  ♦  Starcaller  ♦  Tanith's Knight  ♦  Teardrop Scarab  ♦  Thorn Sorcerer  ♦  Troll  ♦  Troll Knight  ♦  Turtle  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer  ♦  Unobtainable Items  ♦  Vargram the Raging Wolf  ♦  Vulgar Militant  ♦  Wandering Nobles  ♦  Warhawk  ♦  Wild Mouflon  ♦  Wraith Caller \n\n
