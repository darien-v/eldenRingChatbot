Likewise, they can also be bought from his bell bearing.\nThis merchant can't be fought.\nUpon death, drops: \n\nPreceptor's Set\nSeluvis's Bell Bearing\n\nPreceptor Seluvis Shop\nAfter completing his first quest, he will become available as a merchant.\n\nItem Name\nItem Type\nPurchase Value\nAvailability\n\nCarian Phalanx\nSorceries\n12000\nAlways\n\nCarian Retaliation\nSorceries\n9000\nAlways\n\nGlintstone Icecrag\nSorceries\n7500\nAlways\n\nFreezing Mist\nSorceries\n6000\nAlways\n\nGlintblade Phalanx\nSorceries\n2500\nRequires Royal House Scroll\n\nCarian Slicer\nSorceries\n1500\nRequires Royal House Scroll\n\nGreat Glintstone Shard\nSorceries\n 2000\nRequires Academy Scroll\n\nSwift Glintstone Shard\nSorceries\n 600\nRequires Academy Scroll\n\nGlintstone Cometshard\nSorceries\n 12000\nRequires Conspectus Scroll\n\nStar Shower\nSorceries\n 10000\nRequires Conspectus Scroll\n\nSeluvis Questline: How to complete Precetor Seluvis's Quest\nFirst Encounter\n\nSeluvis questline begins as he appears in spectral form on the ground floor of Ranni's Rise after speaking to Ranni for the first time.\nHe asks you to meet him physically at his tower nearby.\n\nSeluvis's Potion\n\nAt Seluvis's Rise, he gives you Seluvis's Potion and tasks you with finding Nepheli Loux and having her drink it.With the potion, there are two major paths to take: \n\nTalk with Gideon Ofnir and discuss Seluvis's plan. He will offer to dispose of the potion, claiming that Seluvis will be none the wiser. Alternatively, you can instead keep the potion and hand it over to Nepheli.\nFeed it to Dung Eater. If the player has made progress in his questline to the point in which he is bound to a chair and accepting Seedbed Curses, it is possible to feed him the potion and return to Seluvis. He will then have a new dialogue option.\n\nIf Nepheli or the Dung Eater was given the potion, their body can be found in Seluvis's laboratory, and their respective Ashes will be available for purchase from Seluvis using Starlight Shards as currency. Note that you must visit Seluvis's lab in the illusion-concealed basement of the building between Renna's Rise and Ranni's Rise, and then receive a free puppet from him, before you can buy the puppet you earned by using the potion.\nRegardless of your decision, Seluvis's response will be the same. \n\nNote: With only a single potion, you must make a choice between Nepheli's or Dung Eater's ashes in a given playthrough. Obtaining the other will require New Game Plus.\n\nBetraying Ranni\n\n[!] Please note: You must complete the next steps before giving Ranni the Fingerslayer Blade. Giving it to her will cause Seluvis's death.\nLocating Seluvis's hidden chambers in the ruins outside of Ranni's Rise and interacting with the message within will allow you to ask Seluvis about the chamber. It is hidden beneath an illusory floor.\nWhen asked about his chambers, he will let you choose one of his puppet Spirit Ashes.\nAfter buying a second puppet, he will tell you about his plot. \n\nThe exact steps to be able to buy the second puppet are as follows: \n\nGive Seluvis's potion to either Nepheli, Dung-eater or Gideon Ofnir.\nAcquire 3 Starlight Shards if you got the Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet the first time, or 2 Starlight Shards if you got the Jarwight Puppet the first time.\nReload the area once, talk to Seluvis(he will repeat his last dialogue), reload the area again and he will give you the option to buy the second puppet. None of his sorceries are required to unlock the second puppet option.\n\nSeluvis seeks to create a potion that will turn even a demigod into a puppet. To make it, he asks you to acquire an Amber Starlight shard, which can found in the Altus Plateau. Pidia, Carian Servant sells a Weathered Map to help deduce its exact location.\nHanding over the Amber Starlight shard will reward you with the Magic Scorpion Charm. \n\nNote: You can stop here with the talisman and continue with Ranni's questline.\n\nAfter reloading the area, he will give you the Amber Draught and ask you to administer it to Ranni. \n\nNote: Receiving the Amber Draught does not lock you into betraying Ranni. When the Draught is in your inventory, you can toggle between administering it to Ranni or simply talking with her to continue her quest line as normal.\n\nUpon doing so, she will wake up both saddened and outraged by your actions. She will demand that you leave, talking to her two more times will result in her instantly killing you (no combat, you just drop dead). Ranni, Iji and Blaidd will have dissapeared from the game and cannot be interacted with again until you use absolve yourself of sins at the Church of Vows. \n\nNote: You can absolve yourself with Celestial Dew at the Church of Vows and continue Ranni's questline without consequence. The NPCs will act as if the Amber Draught episode has never happened.\nSeluvis will be found dead in his tower and Pidia will be killed by his puppets once you get near to his location.\n\nRanni's Questline\n\nAfter giving the Fingerslayer Blade to Ranni, Seluvis can then be found at Seluvis's Rise, dead; thus ending his questline.\nThe end of his questline is synced with Pidia’s. When the questline ends, Pidia expresses shock that the puppets he loved so dearly would betray him, before letting out screams of terror and being torn apart by his puppets, leaving behind Pidia's Bell Bearing and a puppet (Dolores or Nepheli; Nepheli's Puppet Ashes will drop instead of Dolores's Puppet Ashes if she was given the potion).\n\nPreceptor Seluvis Secondary Shop (Puppet Ashes)\nSeluvis's puppet laboratory is located in one of the ruins near his tower. From Ranni's Rise Site of Grace, head outside and visit the first set of ruins on your left. Striking the floor will reveal an illusory floor and a staircase. Inside will be a message: "Seluvis's puppet. Do not touch." After confronting him about the laboratory and exhausting his dialogue, he will offer you one of his puppets. You can now exchange Starlight Shards for other available Ashes.\n\nItem Name\nItem Type\nPurchase Value (Starlight Shards)\nAvailability\n\nFinger Maiden Therolina Puppet\nAshes\n2\nAlways\n\nJarwight Puppet\nAshes\n3\nAlways\n\nDolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet\nAshes\n5\nYou must have given Seluvis's Potion to Nepheli Loux\n\nDung Eater Puppet\nAshes\n5\nYou must have given Seluvis's Potion to Dung Eater\n\nNote: If Seluvis has died due to progress in Ranni's questline, it is still possible to purchase from this shop. Simply return to his dead body and a prompt will appear.Note 2: Alternatively, Dolores's Puppet Ashes will drop from Pidia if the potion is given to Dung Eater, however you will not get Nepheli's Puppet Ashes from Pidia by doing so. (Nepheli's Puppet Ashes are not purchasable in the shop.)\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Preceptor Seluvis\n§Introduction:\n\nI see... You must be Ranni's new hireling.Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts.I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.\nI reside...in another tower, close by.Come and pay me a visit...Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you.But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?\n\n§Visit:\n\nWell, well. You took me at my word.Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze...Hmm, I suppose you're here now.Perhaps I'll give you something to do.I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion.Even you can do that much, can't you?[Accept the task]Good, good.Now I shall hand over the potion in question.[Receives Seluvis's Potion]Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.I except glad tidings. And soon.\n\n§About Nokron:\n\nWell, well. You're asking me about that, are you?The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot.Well...there's no helping it.Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her.[Gives Seluvis's Introduction]\n\nAfter giving someone Seluvis's Potion:\n\nAhh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought.Very well. Then you shall have your gift.Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis.I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but...If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady.\nYou wish to begin right this moment?Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it.\n\nHand over the scroll:\n\nHmm. Is that a scroll?I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but...You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it.So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.That said, don't you dare get your hopes up.More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect......upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.\n\nAfter purchasing all available sorceries:\n\nCome now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not. Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break.\n\nAbout Nepheli:\n\nSo, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.I may have expected too much of her, to begin with.\n\nAbout your chambers:\n\nYou break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?Your oafishness knows no bounds.Fine and well.You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.I believe that makes you my accomplice.You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.But perhaps I can make a very special exception.Now, choose.[Offers choice between Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet and Jarwight Puppet]\n(Upon returning) How's the puppet I gave you? A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?\n\nI want a new puppet (after accepting the free puppet and finding more Starlight Shards):\n\nWhat's that? You want another puppet?Quite the keen paramour, aren't we.But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me.I can hardly just give them away.Oh dear, what's to be done?Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards?If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road.[Opens puppet shop]\n\nAfter purchasing another puppet:\n\nYou're proving to be quite the puppeteer.I've not had an apprentice for...a very long time indeed.\n\nAbout the scheme:\n\nPerhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine?It will produce the finest of puppets.Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands.A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound?\n[I'm interested] Ahh, I knew I had you pegged.You're just like me.Then I'd like you to procure something.A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...\n[I'm not interested] Very good. A wise choice, indeed. You passed my little test with flying colours. I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni. Well done, I'm very proud of you. Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady. \n[Returning to hear more about the scheme] Ah ha. Might you be interested after all? In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni? \n\nAbout Amber Starlight:\n\nProcure it for me.The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...\n\nGive Amber Starlight:\n\nWell, well, you managed to lay your hands on it!The blessed day is finally upon us...Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting.To think, this was once a demigod's very fate...My oh my oh my....\nAh, are you still here?Oh yes, I should give you your reward.Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvelous.[Gives Magic Scorpion Charm]\nNow, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin.The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...\n(Talk again without reloading the area) You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you.The secret* I promised is to be revealed very shortly...*He says "The secret" here, yet the subtitles repeat "The scheme" as in the previous line.\n\n§Returning to Seluvis: \n\nGood, I've been waiting for you.It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet.Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it.[Gives Amber Draught]\nThe dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably.Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's a frail, gentle girl at heart.\n\nAbout the draught:\n\nYou...understand, don't you?That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition.And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted.Just imagine...the pure elation...\n\nAbout the draught (after receiving the Amber Draught and purchasing all available sorceries):\n\nCome now, don't make me wait. I can barely contain myself as it is...\n\nWhen attacked:\n\nAgh! Enough of that, now. Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady?\nYou incorrigible lout. Don't you dare waltz back here again.\n\n§Other:\n\nI have no time for idle chit chat. The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion. Are we understood? Then off you trot.\nBegging for another lesson so soon? There remains much to be done. Make it quick.\n\nPreceptor Seluvis Notes & Trivia\n\nSeluvis' name is a reference to the character Severus Snape from Harry Potter. His Japanese name セルブス (serubusu) is an anagram of Severus (セブルス seburusu).\nGideon and Seluvis seem to have a long-standing hatred, if not rivalry, for each other.\nIn between Ranni's Rise and Renna's Rise, you'll see a ruined building and a set of stairs that go down hidden by an illusory floor, protected by a Noble Sorcerer who is otherwise invisible unless close by. \n\nThere are many doll-like figures around the basement, with a message saying "Seluvis's puppet. Do not touch." in the corner by a man with a jar for a head. A rather eerie thing to note is that puppets' eyes are following player's movements. The bodies of a Perfumer and an Omenkiller are also present, despite none of them being obtainable as puppets. \n\nAfter giving his potion to either Gideon, Nepehli, or Dung Eater, speaking to Seluvis about his basement will become available, in which he will give you access to one free Spirit Ash summon, with the other two available for purchase later. \n\nOne of the ashes is only available if you give the potion to the Dung Eater or Nepheli, rather than letting Gideon dispose of it. (?)\n\nA puppet of Sellen and Nepheli (if you give her the potion) can be found behind another illusory wall in the back of the cellar. \n\nAbove and beyond the violation/creep factor of Seluvis's entire operation with puppetry in general, there are numerous additional context clues that suggest a darkly sexual component to the preceptor's own intentions regarding his unwilling thralls. The presence of Sorceress Sellen's puppet (the only one found stood upright and "activated" within his chambers) kept behind a second privacy-guaranteeing illusory wall in his laboratory AND adjacent to a bed, Seluvis responding to you discovering his secret by offering you a choice (i e. a bribe) of your own puppet between an innocent maiden and an unclothed man (and that, only after commenting that your demonstrated willingness to help him subjugate Nepheli into unwilling puppetry has already effectively made you his "accomplice"), his reference to you being "quite the paramour" should you return to request additional puppets, and arguably worst of all the truly evil implication of his original intent to utilize the player to lay irreversible claim upon body and mind of the foster daughter of his long-standing rival, Gideon. (See the next bullet point for even further context regarding this.)\n\nUpon receiving Dolores as a puppet, it is discovered that Gideon and Seluvis were both in the Roundtable together, with Dolores. It is also noted that the two stopped talking because of her, implying a potential love triangle of sorts. \n\nThe fact you receive Dolores only after giving Nepheli, Gideon's daughter, the potion and later find her as a doll also implies that Seluvis may have grown tired of Dolores as a puppet. It's possible he sought Gideon's adoptive daughter as a replacement.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n

QUESTION
What are the steps to complete Preceptor Seluvis's Quest in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
To complete Preceptor Seluvis's Quest in Elden Ring, first encounter him at Ranni's Rise, receive Seluvis's Potion, give it to Nepheli Loux, visit his hidden chambers, acquire the Starlight Shards, reload the area, purchase the second puppet, obtain the Amber Starlight Shard, give it to Seluvis, receive and decide what to do with the Amber Draught, and then proceed with the consequences depending on your choice, with Seluvis ultimately meeting his fate based on your decisions.
