This is an optional boss as players do not have to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring.\nAbductor Virgin is the normal enemy version of this boss.\nImportant note: If you're teleported to the area before the Abductor Virgins, you can fast travel away as soon as you rest at the Subterranean Inquisition Chamber Site of Grace.\n\nElden Ring Abductor Virgin Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Subterranean Inquisition Chamber\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Abductor Virgins Location\nThe Abductor Virgins guard a passageway between Volcano Manor and Altus Plateau. From the Subterranean Inquisition Chamber Site of Grace,  jump along the pillars to the south and enter a cave. At the end of the cave, the floor will give out and drop you to a lower level. Continue southwards and you'll reach the boss door for the Abductor Virgins. [Map Link]\nThere are two ways to reach the Subterranean Inquisition Chamber Site of Grace:\nFrom Raya Lucaria Academy\nFrom the Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace in Raya Lucaria Academy, head west out the door and around the corner. Ride the looping elevator down to the lower floor where you'll see a normal enemy Abductor Virgin. Let it grab you (use a Sacrificial Twig or Twiggy Cracked Tear to avoid losing runes), and you'll be teleported to a special area in Volcano Manor. Hop across the lava flows and travel southeast, dropping down a few ledges along a lava waterfall until you reach the Subterranean Inquisition Chamber Site of Grace.\nFrom Volcano Manor\nHead west out the door from the Temple of Eiglay Site of Grace, down the stairs, and along the southern edge of the stone platform until you reach a corpse hanging over the side. Walk to the north side of the platform directly opposite this corpse and carefully drop to the rocky platform far below. From there, hop across the lava flows and travel southeast, dropping down a few ledges along a lava waterfall until you reach the Subterranean Inquisition Chamber Site of Grace.\nAbductor Virgin Combat information\n\nHealth: 3,811 HP each\nDefense: 110\nStance: 65\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\nDamage: Standard\nDrops 10,000, Inquisitor's Girandole\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 0\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 0\nFire: 20\nLightning: -20\nHoly: 20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n3,811\n5,636\n6,199\n6,481\n6,763\n7,326\n7,608\n7,890\n\nDefense\n110\n118\n120\n123\n129\n135\n141\n153\n\nRunes\n10,000\n30,000\n33,000\n33,750\n36,000\n36,750\n37,500\n38,250\n\nElden Ring Abductor Virgins Boss Guide\n\nAbductor Virgins Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Abductor Virgins:\n\nUse the Lone Wolf Ashes Ash Summons\nUse items with Lightning\nUse Glintstone Shard Great/Swift Spell\nBring Rune Arc Item\nSuggested weapons: Dragon Halberd (STR/DEX)\nNote: It's possible to cheese this boss by standing on an outcropped ledge where the bosses cannot hit you.\nTakes extra stance damage from lightning damage. 5 casts of Thunderbolt  are sufficient to stance break them, but repeated casts are unlikely to hit the innards as the head usually blocks the innards from the thunderbolt.\n\nMelee Users\nDue to there being two Abductor Virgins in the boss arena, the use of spirit ashes/ multiplayer summons is recommended, as splitting them apart makes the fight significantly easier. The wheel abductor should be killed first, due to its higher mobility and stronger move set. Additionally, the scythe abductor is easier to dodge in the 2 vs. 1 that the wheel version, so he should be your priority. Be careful not to get stuck on any things in the arena or give them an opportunity to both pin you at the same time. \nAttacking the abductors from behind is a good strategy as it prevents them from easier opening and grabbing you, which deals huge amounts of damage possibly outright killing the player. However, attacking an open abductor from the front deals additional damage, providing you are willing to take the risk. The idea is to bait one of them at a time towards you focusing on clearing one at a time as well. Most attacks can also be blocked with a shield when you are overwhelmed. If you manage to keep avoiding, reposition behind to get a few combo hits in order to stagger them. \nMagic and Ranged Users\nBecause of the arena size and the fact that there are double of them, ranged combat is not recommended however should you choose to deal with them in ranged combat, having a spirit summon will help a lot to split up the duo in order to focus on clearing one at a time. Like the melee strategy, ideally clear the wheel variant because of its shorter range and limited moveset. You will need to keep circling around the arena in order to not get caught in a corner and have them both trap you to the edge. Be mindful of the objects that could also get you stuck in this location. \nIf using spells, use Glintstone Shard for quick attacks. Keep dodging back and circling around for a better angle and use your ranged attack in between each of his dealt attacks. Dodge away from any dashes. \nIt is possible to cheese this boss by standing on a ledge on top of a rock formation. From where you enter the boss arena, go toward the right and there should be a ledge high up that you could jump up to using other rocks. From here, the bosses have difficulty hitting you. The sickle abductor virgin can still hit you with a long throw, but such attack is easily dodged. From the ledge, you can fire away ranged attack such as sorcery or projectiles.\n\nAbductor Virgins Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\n  Wheel\n\nAbductor Claws (Grab)\nOpens up its doors and quickly closes the distance in order to grab the unsuspecting target. \nAttempt to roll back and not get pinned by this attack, if it does manage to grab you, you can mash out to get released sooner to reduce damage \n\nCharge \nDashes towards you, touching the wheels will cause damage. \nDodge roll away before its follow up attack.
