The Dark Moon Greatsword scales primarily with Intelligence, Dexterity and Strength and is a staple weapon, in one way or another, in all From Software games. \n\nA Moon Greatsword, bestowed by a Carian queen upon herspouse to honor long-standing tradition.One of the legendary armaments.\nRanni's sigil is a full moon, cold and leaden, and this sword is but a beam of its light.\n\nWhere to Find Dark Moon Greatsword in Elden Ring\nThe Dark Moon Greatsword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nFound below the Cathedral of Manus Celes after giving Ranni the Dark Moon Ring. [Elden Ring Map here]\nYou obtain the Ring by progressing Ranni's Quest, which is complex and requires you to do quite a lot of content: \n\nRadahn must be defeated so that the stars may once again move across the sky (with one crashing into Limgrave and unlocking access to Nokron.\nRetrieve the Fingerslayer Blade from the now accessible eternal city (the chest containing the item can only be opened once you have talked to Ranni at her Rise to join her cause).\nReturn the blade to Ranni, and you will gain access to Ainsel River main from the teleporter located in Renna's Rise.\nPick up the Ranni doll ahead of where you were teleported to, and talk to it three times from the nearby site of grace to be enlisted to fend off the Baleful Shadows located deeper in past Nokstella. Upon defeating said enemy the player is given the Discarded Palace Key.\nUse this key to unlock the chest that houses the Dark Moon Ring, located in the Raya Lucaria Grand Library.\nThe last step is to continue past where you fought the Baleful Shadows, through the Lake of Rot to the Grand Cloister, down to the end where a coffin can be interacted with by the edge of a waterfall. This will take the player down to fight Astel, Naturalborn of the Void. It is after beating this boss that the Dark Moon Ring is actually required, as a seal will block further progress to the elevator to the Moonlight Plateau unless the ring is in the player's possession.\nAt this point it is a case of running to The Cathedral of Manus Celes, carefully falling down the into the cave where Ranni is located with her dead Two Fingers, progressing through the interactions and dialogue with her and being given the Dark Moon Greatsword.\n\nVideo Location\n\nElden Ring Dark Moon Greatsword Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Moonlight Greatsword\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nCan't be enchanted with Magic or boosted by Consumables.\nDark Moon Greatsword can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nCauses Frost buildup:  (55)\nThis weapon has a unique R2, which fires a projectile when buffed by its skill.\nThe projectile does 22 stance damage, or 35 when charged. \n\nThe damage scales with weapon upgrade level and INT.\n\nThe buffed R2's Projectile is affected by Godfrey Icon, Warrior Jar Shard and Shard of Alexander talismans.
