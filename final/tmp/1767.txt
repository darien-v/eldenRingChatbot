They are found in various catacombs - the Tombsward Catacombs, Black Knife Catacombs, and Caelid Catacombs. While the nature of the Cemetary Shades is largely ambiguous, the description of the Mantis Blades they carry suggest that they are grave keepers infested with insects.\nThis is an optional boss, as players are not required to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. While they may be frail, they makes up for it with quick flurries of attacks, while also phasing in and out to strike. It may be worthwhile to bring Consumables and/or put on Equipment that can alleviate the build-up of Hemorrhage as some of their attacks can inflict the status effect. Cemetary Shades drop Lhutel the Headless, the Twinsage Sorcerer Ashes, or Kindred of Rot Ashes depending on which one was defeated.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Great Enemy bosses can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items.\nLesser Cemetery Shade is the normal enemy form of this boss.\n\nInsect-ridden grave keepers.\n\nElden Ring Cemetery Shade Location\n\nTombsward Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nBlack Knife Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nCaelid Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\n\nCemetery Shade Combat information\n\nStance: 70\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being stance broken or parried\nDamage: Slash, Pierce\nInflicts: Hemorrhage\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 0\nFire: 0\nLightning: 0\nHoly: -20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Cemetery Shade Boss Guide\n\nCemetery Shade Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Cemetery Shade:\n\nUse Opaline Bubbletear before entering the boss arena to ensure you'll have time to to use your Spirit Calling Bell.\nUse the Swift Glintstone Shard Spell to hit it, as it can easily dodge slower sorceries.\nBring Stanching Boluses to prevent Hemorrhage.\n\nMelee Users\nBlitz it Down: Cemetery Shade has extremely low health. If you've got enough damage output and the vitality to survive a few hits, you'll probably win a fight where you just trade blows until one of you dies.\nDefensive Maneuvers: If you want to play defensively, equip a shield with 100% physical negation. Block its attacks and guard counter afterwards to get in damage and wear down its Stance. You can also parry its attacks, but the timing is difficult since they come in rapid succession. It can still inflict Hemorrhage through a shield, so be ready to consume a Stanching Bolus.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nQuick Attacks: Cemetery Shade tends to teleport quickly around the arena, making it hard to hit if your cast time is slow or if you're using a ranged weapon skill like the Mighty Shot. Spells that like Swift Glintstone Shard that can be cast quickly are helpful, as long as you avoid its projectile attacks.\nGreatbows Barrage: A hit from a Greatbow will knock Cemetery Shade down if it hits. You can ensure that it does by firing right after it teleports. It'll take enough time getting back up for you to nock another arrow and repeat the process.\n\nCemetery Shade Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nTeleport\nVanishes and reappears elsewhere in the arena. Used either to escape when being attacked or to close distance and reposition before attacking\nWhen the shade teleports close to you, there's a brief period before it starts to attack when you can roll away or start guarding\n\nSpit Trap\nBlows a bubble above its head, then shoots it at you. If it hits, you're unable to move or attack for 5 seconds\nRoll once the bubble is a little bigger than the Shade's head\n\nSpider Grab\nIts head begins to glow and its spider legs wriggle as it brings it down to grab your head. Only used after Spit Trap\nAvoid getting hit by Spit Trap\n\nDual Stab\nDraws back both blades with tips pointed downwards and stabs you with them\nThis attack's windup is difficult to distinguish from Furious Slashing, so the safest course of action is to get far away in case it does that. If you're up for a little risk, it's usually safe to block or dodge this—it will usually teleport afterwards, but often close enough that you can still hit it with an attack\n\nDual Slash\nSlashes both of its blades in a wide arc from its left to its right.\nBlock or dodge to your right, then attack\n\nOne-Two Slash\nSlashes once clockwise then again counterclockwise\nBlock both attacks and then guard counter, or roll backwards\n\nOverhead Slam\nSlams both blades into the ground in front of it\nDodge or block, then attack back. It's at its most vulnerable after this attack\n\nPincer Attack\nSpreads its blades wide, then closes them in on both sides at once\nBecause the attack comes from the sides this is a dangerous move to block. Rolling forward is more reliable\n\nSpinning Swings\nSlashes once from its right to its left, pauses for a moment, then slashes in the opposite direction four times in quick succession while moving forward.\nThe long pause after the first strike gives you a chance to run away or try to stagger it out of the attack. Note that a single dodge won't get you fully out of range of its follow-up swings.\n\nFurious Slashing\nDraws back both blades with tips pointed upwards, slashes twice, pauses briefly, slashes five more times, then finishes with an Overhead Slam\nOnce you see it pull back its blade, roll or run away and prepare to punish the Overhead Slam. Blocking this isn't advisable, since it will still inflict a substantial amount of Hemorrhage\n\n: Attack can be parried\nCemetery Shade Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nOther Notes and Trivia Go Here\n\nCemetery Shade Combo Chart\n\n Cemetery Shade Tombsward Catacombs \n\n__image__\n\nDrops\n2,200Lhutel the Headless\n\nHP\n780\n\nElden Ring Cemetery Shade Boss (Tombsward Catacombs)\n\nOptional boss\nField boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Tombsward Catacombs\nMultiplayer allowed for this boss\nYou can summon Spirit Ashes for this boss\n\nCemetery Shade Combat information\n\nHealth: 780 HP\nDefense: 102.6\nDrops 2,200, Lhutel the Headless\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n781\n2,232\n2,455\n2,566\n2,678\n2,901\n3,013\n3,124\n\nDefense\n102\n117\n120\n123\n129\n135\n140\n152\n\nRunes\n2,200\n11,000\n12,100\n12,375\n13,200\n13,475\n13,750\n14,025\n\n Cemetery Shade Black Knife Catacombs \n\nDrops\n3,500Twinsage Sorcerer Ashes\n\nHP\n691\n\nElden Ring Cemetery Shade Boss (Black Knife Catacombs)\n\nOptional boss\nField boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Black Knife Catacombs\nMultiplayer allowed for this boss\nYou can summon Spirit Ashes for this boss\n\nCemetery Shade Combat information\n\nHealth: 691 HP\nDefense: 107.9\nThis fight features several Skeletons as well, but only the Cemetery Shade needs to be defeated to win\nDrops 3,500, Twinsage Sorcerer Ashes\n\nAdditional Fight Strategy\n\nCall a multi-unit spirit like Lone Wolf Ashes, Raya Lucaria Soldier Ashes, or Wandering Noble Ashes as soon as you enter the boss fight, then sprint to the far side of the room.
