The Misbegotten Shortbow scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for ranged attacks. \n\nShortbow wielded by Winged Misbegotten. Fine fur clings to it.Designed to inflict additional damage by sacrificing range.\n\nWhere to Find Misbegotten Shortbow in Elden Ring\nThe Misbegotten Shortbow weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nPossible drop from flying Misbegotten enemies in Castle Morne and Morne Tunnel in Weeping Peninsula. [Elden Ring Map here]\nPossible drop from Misbegotten enemy, north of the Haligtree Town Plaza Site of Grace. This is the most ideal farming spot, as it can still be farmed after burning the Erdtree.\n\nElden Ring Misbegotten Shortbow Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Barrage\nThis weapon can be infused with Ashes of War\nMisbegotten Shortbow can be upgraded by using Smithing Stones\nSell Value:   100\nBase drop rate is 2% (at 100 Discovery)\nThe Misbegotten bow only appears worth it if you use the Arrow's Reach Talisman or are at very close range as it drops off hard at range, as at the same range, the short bow outperforms it due to its increased range.\nThis really is the only decent ranged option that also has scaling, so with this, the Bastard Sword (only needing one point invested in DEX when starting as a Hero), and the Clawmark Seal (only 2 points in FTH), you have a mostly pure STR Build that is about as versatile as any other build out there.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
