The Lion Greatbow scales primarily with Strength, Dexterity, and is a good Weapon for ranged combat enhanced with gravitational power of the Starscourge and with an added unique skill, Radahn's Rain. It allows the user to fire a flurry of arrows and let it rain onto foes within range.  \n\nGreatbow of black iron wielded by General Radahn. Decorated with a lion mane motif.\nImbued with gravitational power of the Starscourge, when used along with Radahn's Spear, it becomes a true weapon of a champion. \n\nWhere to Find Lion Greatbow in Elden Ring\n\nTrade Remembrance of the Starscourge with Enia at Roundtable Hold.\n\nElden Ring Lion Greatbow Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill :Radahn's Rain\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nLion Greatbow can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nThis weapon grants Radahn's Spears 20% increased physical damage. This is a passive effect, so it will apply to Radhan's Spears fired from another great bow, while this weapon is held in the off-hand. So, for maximum damage, the Golem Greatbow, which has higher AR than this weapon, should be used in the main hand to shoot Radhan's Spears. \n\nYou can put a Lion Greatbow in each hand to stack the 20% damage bonus with Radahn's spears.\n\nSell Value:   1000\nThis Greatbow at +10 and using Radahn's Spear is actually highly effective against Radahn himself. Even with the HP increase given by allies, as long as they keep him in one place performing his rather slow combos and distracting him you can easily tear chunks off his health with the weapon art.\nAll Bows (Crossbows excepted) only need 2/3 of their STR requirement, since they can only be used two-handed. This also means only 54 points of investment into STR are needed to meet the last soft cap at 80, since 54*1.5=81.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below.\nOther notes and player tips go here\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Lion Greatbow\n\nVideos for the Lion Greatbow Coming Soon\n\nLion Greatbow Upgrades in Elden Ring\nPlease see the Upgrades page to understand the weapon bolstering process.\nRequires regular reinforcement with Somber Smithing Stones\nThis upgrade can be enchanted with Magic or boosted with Consumables.\n\nAttack Power\nStat Scaling\nPassive Effects\nDamage Reduction (%)\n\nLion Greatbow\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nSta\nStr\nDex\nInt\nFai\nArc\nAny\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nBst\nRst\n\nStandard\n120\n-\n-\n-\n-\n75\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +1\n137\n-\n-\n-\n-\n82\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +2\n154\n-\n-\n-\n-\n90\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +3\n172\n-\n-\n-\n-\n97\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +4\n189\n-\n-\n-\n-\n105\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +5\n207\n-\n-\n-\n-\n112\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +6\n224\n-\n-\n-\n-\n120\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +7\n241\n-\n-\n-\n-\n127\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +8\n259\n-\n-\n-\n-\n135\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +9\n276\n-\n-\n-\n-\n142\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nStandard +10\n294\n-\n-\n-\n-\n150\nD\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nElden Ring Greatbows\n\nErdtree Greatbow  ♦  Golem Greatbow  ♦  Greatbow\n\n
