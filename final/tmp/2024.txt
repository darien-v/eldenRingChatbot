CONTEXT
\n\n HP  \n\nType\nBase Stat\n\nEffect\nDetermines your current and total health.\n\nInfluenced by\nVigor\n\nHP or Hit Points is one of the Stats in Elden Ring. Stats refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. HP is a measure of your health and how much damage you can take before falling in combat. It is one of the Base Stats which are directly affected by a player's Main Attribute distribution. Stats such as HP are an important aspect of character progression in Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring HP Stat General Information\n\nHP or Hit Points is a Base Stat that serves as a measure of a character's health and how much damage they can take before falling in combat.\nHP is one of the most prevalent stats and is constantly displayed on the HUD, represented by a red bar that depletes as you take damage.\nWhen your character's HP is depleted to 0, you die and drop all held Runes at the site of your death. You will then respawn at the last Site of Grace you visited. Alternatively, if you've passed a Stake of Marika checkpoint before your death, you can choose to spawn at the last one you've passed.\nResting at a Site of Grace fully replenishes your HP and FP. However, this also causes most enemies to respawn.\n\nHow to increase Character HP in Elden Ring\n\nA player's Maximum HP can be increased intrinsically by adding points to Vigor when leveling up.\nVigor is one of the 8 Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on to level up.\nThe ability to level up is unlocked shortly after meeting Melina for the first time near the beginning of the game.\nLeveling up can be done at any Sites of Grace once unlocked.\nThe amount of Runes required to raise an Attribute increases with each character Level.\nRunes are obtained primarily by defeating Enemies and Bosses.
