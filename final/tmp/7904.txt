The Hero has high Strength and Vigor with some arcane. It starts the game level 7, with a battle axe and leather shield. The Classes of Elden Ring only determine the starting Stats and Equipment of the player, but as the game progresses, players can freely change their build to their preferred playstyle. The Hero is a Strength-based class that begins the game with an axe.\n\nA stalwart Hero, at home with a battleaxe, descended from a badlands chieftain\n\nHero Starting Equipment for Elden Ring\nThis class starts with the following equipment:\n\nBattle Axe\nLarge Leather Shield\n\nArmor:\n\nChampion Headband\nChampion Pauldron\nChampion Bracers\nChampion Gaiters\n\nStarting items for Hero  in Elden Ring\nThis class starts with the following items:\n\nMemory of Grace\nPlayer Choice of Keepsake\n\nHero Builds in Elden Ring\n\nBarbarian Written Guide\n\nChampion Written Guide\n\nColossal Knight Written Guide\n\nElden Ring Hero Notes & Tips\n\nThis class replaces the "Champion" of the Closed Network Test.\nThis class' stats are optimized for:\n\nPure Strength builds that do not increase their Dexterity higher than 12, after which Vagabond becomes more optimal. \n\nPure Strength weapons include Brick Hammer, Duelist Greataxe, Gargoyle's Great Axe, Giant-Crusher and Nightrider Glaive.\n\nStrength/Intelligence build that do not require Dexterity scaling, with more than 60 Strength and less than 20 Intelligence. \n\nStrength/Intelligence weapons that primarily scale with Strength include Ruins Greatsword, Rosus' Axe and Starscourge Greatsword.\n\nPure Arcane builds that do not invest any points in other damage stats. If more Dexterity is required, Bandit may be more optimal. \n\nInfusable weapons with innate status effects that only require 9 or less Dexterity requirement include Spiked Club, Morning Star, Star Fist and Venomous Fang. All of which can be infused with Occult, which affects status effect buildup based on Arcane stat. The Spiked Club in particular has A scaling for Arcane under Occult infusion.\n\nStrength/Arcane builds that utilize heavy weapons to deal high damage or to inflict status effect via Occult infusion or innate Arcane scaling. At 34 Strength and 60 Arcane, some weapons' attack rating can rival that of Pure Strength builds when applied with Occult infusion; Whereas at 34 Strength, 19 Dexterity and 55 Arcane, it offers the versatiliy of being able to utilize some of the Dex Arcane weapons, such as Bloody Helice and Rivers of Blood while carrying a greatshield simultaneously. \n\nStrength Arcane weapons with innate status effects include Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear, Great Omenkiller Cleaver, Great Stars, Flamberge, Spiked Club, Grave Scythe, Rotten Battle Hammer and Rotten Greataxe.\nStrength Arcane weapons with high attack rating include Marais Executioner's Sword, Warped Axe, Greatsword and Brick Hammer.\n\nStrength/Dexterity quality builds that do not intend to increase mind. If you do require more mind, Vagabond becomes more optimal.\nWhile the Hero class is intended to be used for Strength and Strength Arcane builds in mind, 16 Strength is also the exact mimimum Strength requirement for the Bloody Helice, meaning that this class can also be used for Dex Arcane build that focuses on the use of the Helice.\n\nNotes, Tips, and Trivia go here\n\nElden Ring Classes\n\nAstrologer  ♦  Bandit  ♦  Confessor  ♦  Prisoner  ♦  Prophet  ♦  Samurai  ♦  Vagabond  ♦  Warrior  ♦  Wretch\n\n
