CONTEXT
\n\n Edgar \n\nLocation\nCastle Morne, Weeping Peninsula\n\nRole\nMorne Castellan, Quest NPC\n\nVoiced by\nRichard Hainsworth\n\nEdgar is an NPC in Elden Ring. Edgar is Irina's father and introduces himself as the warden of Castle Morne. He can be found sitting on a bench in a non-hostile area of the ramparts of the castle. His NPC Summon Sign can be used to fight against the Leonine Misbegotten once he has received Irina's Letter.\n\n I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself. But you can see how things have turned out.\n\nEdgar Location in Elden Ring\nEdgar can be found at Castle Morne in the Weeping Peninsula. [Map Link]\n\nTo find Edgar: \n\nEnter Castle Morne and go up the lift.\nGo straight, past the Misbegotten on the mound, and turn right at the resting Pumpkin Head.\nClimb the ladder at the end of the path on the right, up to the ramparts.\nFollow the path of the ramparts. On the left, past a narrower section, where two flying Misbegotten are hovering, some boxes hide a ladder. Descend the ladder or simply jump down below to another section of the ramparts where some knights are fighting more Misbegotten.\nHead straight toward the fight, past the gallows, and climb the set of stairs circling up to the next corner of the castle. Edgar will be sitting alone on a bench.\n\nEdgar may move to the Bridge of Sacrifice, to Irina's  location, as part of her questline. [Map Link]\nThis NPC can be fought\nIf defeated, drops: \n\nBanished Knight's Halberd+8\n1000 Runes\nShabriri Grape (Whatever area he died in must be reloaded - the grape will appear where you usually find him in that area).\n\nEven after completing Edgar's questline, he will invade your world when visiting the Revenger Shack in Liurnia.\n\nEdgar Questline: How to complete Edgar's Quest\nEdgar's quest is part of  Irina's questline. Speak to Irina near the first site of grace of Weeping Peninsula, and she will ask you to help deliver a letter, "Irina's Letter", to her father in Castle Morne, at the southern tip of the Weeping Peninsula.\n\nAfter successfully delivering her letter to Edgar, he will lament that he is not able to go to Irina because of his ongoing duties at Castle Morne - he cannot allow the Grafted Blade Greatsword to be stolen by the Misbegotten (even though it is already in the hands of a Misbegotten and he is just sitting on a bench doing nothing, you cannot even summon him for the boss of the area until you give him Irina's letter.)\n\nUpon delivering the letter to Edgar, return to Irina to find an Iron Cleaver embedded in the ground next to her dead body.\nKilling Edgar will progress the questline in the same way.\n\nAfter defeating the Leonine Misbegotten and retrieving the sword, Edgar will thank the player and return to Irina.\nEdgar  can then be found next to Irina. Talk to him to progress the questline.\nIf the player travels to the Revenger's Shack, Edgar will appear as a hostile invader in the form of Edgar the Revenger. If the player defeats him before killing Leonine Misbegotten, then the player will miss out on Edgar as a summon, and he won't be in his first spot to thank the player and won't appear near Irina's corpse.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Edgar\nIntroduction\n\nAh, there's a face I've not seen before. I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself. But you can see how things have turned out. The menials have all rebelled. They gave me good service, or so I thought, but it seems it was all an act. Foul creatures, as it's said. And true enough they're foul inside and out. I'm sorry to disappoint you, But whatever you've come here to do, I'm afraid Castle Morne won't hold much longer. Take this, by way of apology.\n\nWhen attacked\n\nUgh! I haven't a clue what's got into you, but as Lord of this castle, I will stand for it no longer!\nAh, now I see! You had a hand in Irina's undoing! What could she have done to deserve that?\n(On player kill) And now even your ilk have complicated matters.\n\nDeath\n\nPlease forgive me, Lord Godrick.\nForgive me, Irina... I will join you soon enough.\n\nWhen giving Irina's Letter\n\nI see, from Irina... Thank you. I'm in your debt. But I can't leave yet. Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain. To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands.\nIf you see Irina, do tell her. That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty.\n\nUpon Retrieving the Sword\n\n"I'm in your debt. I'm no longer bound by duty. Once I've rescued Irina, I will spend my remaining days with her. Thanks to you, I will be reunited with Irina. And devote my remaining days to her. Irina has a gentle nature, though. I only hope it remains intact."\n\nOn Seeing Irina's Death\n\n"Irina...How could this be...My daughter deserved better...The fault lies...with me. I chose duty over my daughter's safety. And that is how fate has answered...I'll find them. The foul wretches responsible for this. I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them. Rest assured, Irina. It will be done."\n\nElden Ring Edgar Notes & Trivia\n\nEdgar wears an unobtainable variant of the the Banished Knight Set without a helmet. His unique unaltered Banished Knight Armor appears without ornamental horns.\nDuring combat, Edgar uses a Banished Knight's Halberd with the Spinning Strikes Ash of War, and a sacred seal, which he uses to cast Golden Vow.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
