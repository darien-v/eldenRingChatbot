Esgar, Priest of Blood is a highly aggressive humanoid boss equipped with a dagger and utilizes bleed attacks and spells. He is accompanied by two dogs that also inflict bleed. Esgar can be found in the Leyndell Catacombs, deep beneath Leyndell, Royal Capital. This is an optional boss as players don't have to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring, but will be rewarded with useful items and Runes for doing so.\n\n Aided by his two ferocious dogs, this Priest is capable of the deadliest hemorrhage-inducing attacks.\n\nElden Ring Esgar, Priest of Blood Boss\nEsgar, Priest of Blood is a Boss found in Leyndell, Royal Capital.

These catacombs are accessed through the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds. Esgar's boss door can be found just in front of the Leyndell Catacombs site of grace near the entrance. However, you will need to venture deeper into the catacombs to unlock it.\nEven after Leyndell, Royal Capital becomes Leyndell, Ashen Capital, the sewers are not affected and thus Esgar can still be fought.\n\nEsgar, Priest of Blood Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG (3511), NG+ (??), NG++ (??), NG+3 (??), NG+4 (??), NG+5 (??), NG+6 (??), NG+7 (??)\nDamage: Standard (dogs),  Standard, Slash,Pierce,  Magic, Fire (Esgar)\nInflicts: Hemorrhage\nParryable: Yes (Esgar) No (dogs)\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being parried (Esgar)\nImmune to critical attacks.

For example if an absorption is 60. 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number= less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances:\n\nPoison: 236\nScarlet Rot: 236\nHemorrhage: 168\nFrostbite: 168\nDeath: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers is the buildup amount to trigger it. For example if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Esgar, Priest of Blood Boss Guide\n\nEsgar, Priest of Blood Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nEsgar, Priest of Blood Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Esgar, Priest of Blood:\n\nUse items that boost your Robustness such as Invigorating Cured Meat to slow the build-up of bleed effects.\nEsgar is a human-type enemy, therefore bring weaponry inflicting Status Effects.\nFocus on the two dogs first before moving onto the boss.  Players having trouble with the dogs can try using the Beast-Repellent Torch.\nConsider using a summon to distract the boss and/or one of the dogs.\n\nGeneral Strategy\nEsgar is a relatively simple boss that relies heavily on the bleed mechanic applied by both himself and his dogs. It is imperative that you do not let this effect build up as the blood loss triggered can one-shot players even at higher levels. Consider using a summon to distract either the boss or one of the dogs for an easier time. You should aim for the boss only after taking care of his canine companions, as they are much quicker and also inflict bleed. The dogs do not take too much to kill but getting hit by them can prove dangerous due to the bleed.\nEsgar himself will mostly try to close the distance with dodge rolls and jump attacks. His weapon automatically builds up bleed on hit but he does not have any complex or extensive combos. After dodging his jump attacks, you can punish him with heavy jump attacks of your own to send him plopping facedown on the ground. When he casts his Swarm of Flies move, get ready to dodge through the slow-moving initial swarm. A direct hit from this will cause a burst that quickly builds bleed. Another attack Esgar will use commonly is the Bloodflame Talons. This attack has a very obvious telegraph and the higher damage portion only happens after a short delay.\nMelee Users\nFor melee users, you can use any weapon you want, this boss does not have a lot of poise and you can stagger and stunlock him easily. You just have to be careful with its attacks as it stacks bleed and can build-up quite quickly, and being on the receiving end of his attacks can mean life or death if you're not careful. Take your time in getting a few hits in with him, use the whole arena and kite him when needed, take advantage of the pillars in the area to block or hide from some of his attacks, like the swarm of flies, then flask up when needed. You can get a few attacks in after his jumping attack, just don't get too greedy as he can use Swarm of Flies or the Bloodflame Talons, which can deal massive burst damage on impact.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor magic and ranged users, it is recommended that you use a spell/incantations or a skill that can deal AoE damage at the start of the fight where you can clip Esgar as well as his canine companions. Then you can equip a heavy-hitting spell/incantation of your choice in whittling down his health if you've managed to take out the canine companions. Esgar can rush towards you if you keep on creating distance, or he can use some of his projectile attacks, either way, just keep kiting him while using your ranged attacks and take advantage of the pillars in the area.\nFor Incantation users - Ekzykes's Decay with around 30-35 Mind is a free win, as both dogs and Esgar will not have a chance to retaliate/jump away.\n\nEsgar, Priest of Blood Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwarm of Flies\nEsgar releases a swarm of flies that fly towards his target, bursting into a larger AoE that deals damage and builds up bleed.\nDodge through the initial projectile. It has decent tracking and will likely hit if you dodge backwards or sideways.\n\nBloodflame Talons\nEsgar slashes with magical claws in front of him. After a short delay, an explosion is released from the claw marks.\nMaintain distance and do not close in until the explosion happens.\n\nBloody Slash\nUses the dagger to unleash a rending blood slash in a wide arc.\nDodge roll through or either side of the projectile.\n\nJumping Attack\nRuns forward and performs a jumping attack with the dagger.\nDodge roll through the attack, and you can get a 1-3 swings in depending on your weapon.\n\nEsgar, Priest of Blood Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: ??\nConsidering his obvious blood associations and the fact that he drops Lord of Blood's Exultation, Esgar is almost certainly a servant of Mohg. What exactly he's doing in the catacombs is unclear - possibly he has been sent there to retrieve Mohg's Shackle, which is found nearby the catacombs' entrance.\nPossible refference to Titchy Gren from Dark Souls 2, or more precisely, Nahr Alma, the God of Blood. \n\nEsgar, Priest of Blood Image Gallery\n[screenshots and artwork go here]\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
