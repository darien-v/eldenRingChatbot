Danger and discovery lurk around every corner in FromSoftware's largest game to-date.\nHidetaka Miyazaki, President and Game Director of FromSoftware Inc known for directing critically-acclaimed games in beloved franchises including Armored Core, Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.\nGeorge R R Martin is the On  the New York Times bestselling author of many novels, including the acclaimed series A Song of Ice and One - A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast For Crows, and A Dance with Dragons. As a writer-producer, he has worked on The Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and pilots that were never made.\n\nElden Ring Reveal\n\nElden Ring has been in production since the end of the Dark Souls III DLC. This is in contrast to Sekiro, that begun production in 2015 after Bloodborne.\nElden Ring will release on PC, Xbox One and Playstation 4\nBandai Namco is publishing and has registered the Elden Ring IP\nElden Ring Release Date – From our observations The release window for this game is unlikely to match FromSoftware’s traditional March-April, and is more likely to fall into Dark Souls’ September-October release.\n“Elden Ring is a third-person action RPG with a fantasy setting… gameplay is not so far from Dark Souls… Elden Ring belongs to the same genre.”\nPlethora of weapons, magic and builds, and a focus on RPG elements. FromSoftware expects equipment variety to be larger than Souls in this regard.\nNo main fixed protagonist, players create the characteristics and personality of their character. This leads us to believe Character Creation is a given.\nThe World of Elden Ring is vast and interconnected. No longer a continuity of “levels”, players see vast landscapes in between the “dungeon-esque” areas.\nThe larger world scale allows for freedom, promotes exploration, and introduces new and exciting mechanics, such as Horse Riding and Mounted Combat.\nElden Ring is a “natural evolution of Dark Souls.” New mechanics needed by this larger world. Expect FromSoftware’s trademark challenging boss battles.\nTowns won’t be full of villagers, merchants and the like. They will be ruins, dungeons and exploration hubs. As Souls there is no vast population of NPCs.\nThe NPCs the player finds are expected to be the most compelling yet in the studio’s work, thanks to Martin’s involvement in the Mythos. George R. R. Martin has written the world’s mythos and Hidetaka Miyazaki has written the game story.\nStory will be revealed through “fragments of environmental storytelling” as in previous Souls games.\nMythos and the present moment of the player are connected and exploration will lead players to understand why things are as they are.\nThere is no information at time of writing about multiplayer/online/invasions.\n\nA NEW FANTASY WORLD\nJourney through the Lands Between, a new fantasy world created by Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of the infl uential DARK SOULS video game series, and George R. R. Martin, author of The New York Times best-selling fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. Unravel the mysteries of the Elden Ring’s power. Encounter adversaries with profound backgrounds, characters with their own unique motivations for helping or hindering your progress, and fearsome creatures.\nWORLD EXPLORATION IN THE LANDS BETWEEN\nELDEN RING features vast fantastical landscapes and shadowy, complex dungeons that are connected seamlessly. Traverse the breathtaking world on foot or on horseback, alone or online with other players, and fully immerse yourself in the grassy plains, suffocating swamps, spiraling mountains, foreboding castles and other sites of grandeur on a scale never seen before in a FromSoftware title.\nGENRE-DEFINING GAMEPLAY\nCreate your character in FromSoftware’s refi ned action-RPG and define your playstyle by experimenting with a wide variety of weapons, magical abilities, and skills found throughout the world. Charge into battle, pick off enemies one-by-one using stealth, or even call upon allies for aid. Many options are at your disposal as you decide how to approach exploration and combat. A free upgrade to the PlayStation 5 version will be available for players who purchase ELDEN RING on PlayStation 4, and SmartDelivery will be supported for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nElden Ring Wiki\n\nPUBLISHER\nBANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc.\n\nDEVELOPER\nFromSoftware Inc.\n\nPLAYERS\n1 to 4 (from official FromSoftware site)\n\nGENRE\nAction RPG\n\nPLATFORMS\nPLAYSTATION®4, XBOX ONE, PCFREE UPGRADE: PLAYSTATION®5, XBOX SERIES X|S\n\nRATING\nRP – Rating Pending\n\nLOCALIZATION VOICE OVER\nEnglish\n\nSUBTITLE\nEnglish, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Neutral Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Korean\n\nEverything We Know About Elden Ring: Pre & Post Launch Content\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree\n\nShadow of the Erdtree DLC Trailer Breakdown\n\nShadow of the Erdtree DLC Trailer!\n\nWhat to Expect in Shadow of the Erdtree?\nThe Land of Shadow. A place obscured by the Erdtree. Where the goddess Marika first set foot.\nA land purged in an unsung battle. Set ablaze by Messmer’s flame.\nIt was to this land that Miquella departed. Divesting himself of his flesh, his strength, his lineage. Of all things Golden.\nAnd now Miquella awaits the return of his promised Lord. \nNew Story\nGuided by Empyrean Miquella, players are beckoned to the Land of Shadow, a place obscured by the Erdtree where the goddess Marika first set foot. In these strange new lands, players discover the dark secrets of the world as they meet others who follow in Miquella’s footsteps with ulterior motives.\n\nNew Location\nElden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree takes players beyond the Lands Between to explore the Land of Shadow, a completely new world from Elden Ring. Players can seamlessly travel back and forth between its vast maps interspersed with diverse situations and meticulous dungeons where menacing enemies roam.\n\nNew Content\nShadow of the Erdtree adds new Weapons, equipment, weapon skills and Magic not found in the base game ELDEN RING, along with new Enemies, Boss encounters and plotlines to further increase players' RPG freedom. Take on these threats with the new powers you can acquire.\n\nShadow of the Erdtree Speculations\nThe Erdtree featured in the cover art is bleeding Gold, which may also mean that this is a post-destruction story that happens after the Endings of the game. Zooming into the image seems to show ashes coming down from the tree branches, so it may both be a post-burning scenario, or a pre-breaking scenario when the Golden Order was first corrupted. The bleeding Erdtree seems to be strangled by another twisted tree - some speculated that this twisted tree is an extension of Godwyn's roots. The sky above the two trees is sunless - has an eclipse befallen the Lands Between? \nWe can also see ethereal structures on the field - could these be the ghostly tombs of the Haligtree soldiers who sacrificed themselves in a flash to guide Miquella's return? \nAccording to Hidetaka Miyazaki in interview with several media outlets, the new DLC will be have the following content:\n\nA new area larger than Limgrave\nNew Legacy Dungeons\nMore than 10 new Boss fights to grit your teeth against\nNew Weapons, Equipment and Armor\nAs much as eight new Weapons categories added to the base game\nNew Ashes of War\nNew Locations\n\n Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree \n\nRelease Date\nJune 21, 2024\n\nAnnouncement Date\nFebruary 28, 2023\n\nPlatforms\nPlaystation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n\nDevelopers\nFromSoftware Inc.\n\nPublishers\nBANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc.\n\nShadow of the Erdtree PC Requirements\nRecommended Requirements\n\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\nOS: Windows® 10, Windows® 11, 64bit\nProcessor: INTEL CORE I7-8700K or AMD RYZEN 5 3600X\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1070 8 GB or AMD RADEON RX VEGA 56 8 GB\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 60 GB available space\nSound Card: Windows Compatible Audio Device\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\nOS: Windows® 10, Windows® 11, 64bit\nProcessor: INTEL CORE I5-8400 or AMD RYZEN 3 3300X\nMemory: 12 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1060 3 GB or AMD RADEON RX 580 4 GB\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 60 GB available space\nSound Card: Windows Compatible Audio Device\n\nElden Ring Story Overview\n\nElden Ring The Lands Between\nThe Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, and those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by the Elden Ring and the "Erdtree". Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed lost their grace, were exiled, and labeled as the Tarnished.  As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered across the lands and its pieces were picked up by many of the 6 demigods, where they inherited different powers and have physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power.\n\nThe Lands Between is broken into 6 distinct areas that are overseen by a demigod and feature a central hub that connects all these 6 areas. According to an interview with Miyazaki, players will have total freedom as to the order they want to tackle each area, and it is up to the player how they want to approach it. Apart from that the hub will not be accessible at the beginning of the game, which means you will need to progress the game until you reach the hub area.\nAccording to Hidetaka Miyazaki: "The Lands Between is supposed to invoke this feeling of something that's very mysterious and very ethereal – and we hope that when players play the game, they're going to experience that." \n\nThe Tarnished in Elden Ring\nIn the official reveal trailer that was presented in E3 2021, you'll see a softly spoken, hooded woman saying "The Tarnished, will soon return." The question is, who and what is The Tarnished? Simple, The Tarnished is you, the player, you are one of the Tarnished that have been exiled upon losing their blessing that was given by the Elden Ring and the "Erdtree", a tree that hosts the source and life of The Lands Between. Very much like in previous Souls games, you are the chosen undead or the ashen one. You are then called back to The Lands Between, as well as the other Tarnished after the destruction of the Elden Ring to recover the shards of the Elden Ring, to make them whole once again, and to become the lord of The Lands Between.\n\nAccording to Hidetaka Miyazaki in an interview: " I feel like one of the main themes of the game is how the player, the Tarnished, approaches or treats this new-found grace and this return to the land that they were once banished from, how they interpret this and the meaning. It's not just the player-character, of course, it's lots of characters in the game, who are all beckoned back and will have their own adventures and motives. We want the player to discover for themselves what that means and how they want to begin their adventure."\n\nCombat in Elden Ring\n\nWhat is Stealth in Elden Ring?\nStealth mechanics seem that will be present and may be useful in combination with backstab attacks, also the game may feature a night and day mechanic that may affect the stealth mechanic as well. Stealth as many are aware of, will allow the player to crouch, sneak, and hide behind tall grass to be less detected by the enemy. Stealth will play an integral mechanic in combat since you can use it to your advantage to sneak behind an enemy to instantly kill them or at least deal a large amount of damage from using a stealth attack.\n\nFreedom in Character Build\nIn the trailer that was revealed in E3 2021, we see a lot of unique Skills, magical abilities, and even having a horse leaping up a cliffside, as well as attacking while riding your Mount. These are Skills that you pick up through the player's progression and exploration. There are some cases in that a player can acquire a skill by purchasing it from merchants or learning them from an NPC, but during an interview with Hidetaka Miyazaki that was featured, he stresses that in general, skills are hidden throughout the game's world, and it is the player's responsibility to discover these through exploration.\n\nElden Ring will have complete freedom when it comes to building up your character, you are basically free to combine your Skills with different weapons and equipment, and you'll learn magic as well. Skills are freely interchangeable between a large variety of weapons as per Hidetaka Miyazaki, and that there are around 100 Skills. With having fewer restrictions, players will have even more variations of Builds that are even richer than previous Souls games.\nElden Ring's Day & Night Cycle\nReal-time changes are featured in Elden Ring in the form of the Day and Night cycle, as well as Dynamic Weather. These features also heavily affect gameplay, combat, and the world you are exploring. For example, in cases where you are roaming at night, both players and enemies will change in terms of aggression due to a decrease in visibility, and some unique enemies that only appear at night will come out.\n\nAre there Covenants in Elden Ring?\nTraditional Souls Covenants or Factions are not featured in Elden Ring. Elden Ring Covenants are instead player-chosen allegiances or pledges undertaken to specific deities or groups of NPCs. Based on previous titles, players can expect their covenant to affect their gameplay by changing their Online interactions, or by creating new situations where users can collect special items or defeat certain enemies to rank up and obtain special rewards. Rewards are usually Magic, Weapons, and Armor pieces.\n\nNew Mechanics in Elden Ring\nElden Ring will have a large scale in terms of the world and exploration, and to go hand-in-hand with this, some new mechanics are introduced such as jumping, yes players can jump now, as well as riding on horseback (Mounts). Hidetaka Miyazaki strongly suggests that you thoroughly search and explore every section of the world to find Skills that are hidden.\n\nThere are a number of choices as well that players can approach their way of combat, some may be brave and choose to go on head-to-head, while others would rather have allies such as being able to summon the spirits of deceased enemies. Our Combat page dives into the different aspects and mechanics of the new and familiar combat tactics for Elden Ring.\nSummoning the Dead in Elden Ring\nOne of the combat aspects of Elden Ring is being able to summon Spirits that can help you in battle. These spirits are usually the fallen souls of the enemies that you defeat, and summoning them will have them assist you in combat. These are your offline summons, and it is quite different to have your friends or other players summoned to your session which is available in Online co-op play. What's interesting with multiplayer is that you can even set a password on your calling marks, so that this way you can just have your friends join your session, if you're more comfortable with that rather than having a random drop-in.\n\nAccording to Miyazaki, "|These spirit summons, we feel like – as well as there being a large variety to them – they're a nice collectible hidden element within the game world to discover and to equip as you go. They offer a lot of different strategic options, but also the player might find that they just like a certain enemy tagging along with them, a certain summon pleases them aesthetically. So there's a lot of strategic and a lot of personal touch to these summons. And we hope that players will also enjoy discovering their own progression elements as well."\nElden Ring Game Difficulty\nThere will only be ONE difficulty in Elden Ring. The decision of FromSoftware to lean towards this feature can benefit both new and veteran players of this genre. Elden Ring features a large scale when it comes to its world and exploration, so it does make sense that it really is up to you on how you want to tackle the game, it is highly encouraged that players carefully assess the situation that lies ahead and to find different ways to deal with it. This also provides a good camaraderie within the community since everyone can share their experiences and hopefully help one another.\n\nElden Ring Official Images\n\nElden Ring Images from Summer Game Fest 2021 Trailer\n\nCheck out our other Wikis:\nComplete List of Wikis\n\n
