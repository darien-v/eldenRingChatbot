Especially very good against those who repeatedly use the Rivers of Blood Ash of War.\nWhile the Bloody Helice is intended to be a Dex Arcane weapon, the weapon scaling and bleed buildup is primarily affected by Arcane stat alone, meaning that a Strength Arcane build with at least 19 Dexterity can utilize both the Bloody Helice and a greatshield simultaneously, which offers high mobility and good defense.\nSell Value:   200 Runes.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, the speed of  Heavy Thrusting Swords crouching attacks has been reduced. Also the stagger caused by double-handed Heavy Thrusting Swords jumping attacks has been reduced. And finally, Poise damage has also been reduced, but only for PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

QUESTION
How can one effectively utilize the unique skill Dynast's Finesse with the Bloody Helice weapon in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
By using Dynast's Finesse with Bloody Helice in Elden Ring, one can avoid an attack and follow up with a strong attack, utilizing additional FP during the spinning dodge with no FP cost if stat requirements are not met, making it effective for spellcasters to evade attacks after casting spells but without damage immunity. It features a unique R2 shared with Dragon King's Cragblade and a feint animation along with a two-hit combo follow-up attack using an R2 input.
