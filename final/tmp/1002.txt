It was sent to the Lands Between through a golden star long before the events of the game.\nThis boss is NOT optional, as it is the final fight of the game, appearing immediately upon defeating Radagon of the Golden Order. As with many endgame bosses, Weapons, Incantations, and Spirit Ashes capable of inflicting Black Flame are highly recommended as they deal damage over time based on the boss' maximum HP. In addition, Stamina-boosting Equipment is recommended as the boss is highly mobile and you may find yourself using a lot of Stamina chasing it down. If you die to the Elden Beast, you are required to fight Radagon again before rechallenging it. It drops the Elden Remembrance when defeated.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Shardbearers drop their own unique Great Rune and Remembrance capable of being transformed int powerful Weapons, Spells, Ashes of War, and Talismans for the player.\n\nIt is said that long ago, the Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between, which would later become the Elden Ring. \nIt was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and the living incarnation of the concept of Order.\n\nElden Ring Elden Beast Boss\nElden Beast is a God found in the Stone Platform.\n\nThis boss is NOT optional.\nThis is a God boss.\nClosest Site of Grace: Elden Throne\nIs multiplayer allowed for this boss? Yes\nSpirit Ashes can be summoned for this boss.\n\nElden Ring Elden Beast Location\nElden Beast appears immediately upon defeating Radagon of the Golden Order.\n\nElden Beast Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG (22,127), NG+ (22,149), NG+2 (24,363), NG+3 (25,471), NG+4 (26,578), NG+5 (28,793), NG+6 (29,901), NG+7 (31,008)\nDefense: ???\nStance: 150\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being stance broken\nDamage:  Standard, Pierce, Holy\n\nAbsorptions\n\nPhy (Standard): 10\nPhy (Slash): 10\nPhy (Strike): 10\nPhy (Pierce): 10\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 80\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if an absorption is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\nDeath Blight: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Elden Beast Boss Guide\n\nElden Beast Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nElden Beast Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Elden Beast:\n\nUse the Mimic Tear Ash summons.\nIf your build is Arcane-focused, the Occult enhancement gives you excellent physical damage in lieu of ailments which cannot affect this boss.\nUse Lord's Divine Fortification to greatly reduce the damage of Elden Beast's many holy attacks. Alternatively, Divine Fortification, Haligdrake Talisman (+2, does stack with spells) or Holyproof Dried Liver (as 1.04, it does not stack with spells) help to a lesser degree. \n\nLord's Divine Fortification paired with Haligdrake Talisman and light armor with high Holy resistance can give even 70% holy damage negation, which makes most attacks survivable with 40 VIG.\n\nUse the Green Turtle Talisman to increase stamina regeneration so you can get more attacks in after chasing down Elden Beast.\nAt the beginning of the fight, run behind the beast, because it usually starts by breathing fire. This will avoid the attack and give you an opportunity to deal damage.\nElden Beast is extremely resistant to holy and moderately resistant to other elements, so stick to physical damage if possible.\nDue to high HP pool, any %-based attacks like Black Flame Tornado does the job fine.\nAvoid using the locking on feature when Elden Beast is close to you, this can screw up your attacks.\nWhen the Elden Beast jumps into the air, disengage the lock-on and watch for the rings. Jump over instead of rolling through them.\nIt is preferred to, if possible, to do this fight solo. If you must summon a player, it is recommended to only have 1 other as more than 1 will increase the difficulty as the boss gains more HP.\nPest Threads incantation can deal a large amount of damage to the boss, especially when caster is at Beast back.\nRadahn's Rain combined with Radahn's Spears can deal 2k+ damage to him per volley. \n\nTry to lock on to his body instead of head.\n\nIf timed correctly the Elden Beast can be staggered before casting elden stars, preventing the boss from using the first guaranteed cast. This can be done by stacking stance damage against the Elden Beast before it reaches half health and repeatedly using a high stance damage weapon or weapon art when it attempts to cast. Colossal Weapons and some weapon arts such as Square Off deal high stance damage.\n\nMelee Users\nRight when entering the arena, there will be a few seconds of time to run towards Elden Beast before it initiates any form of attacks. The first attack (Most if not all the time) is a yellow fire breath attack, to avoid this, as stated to the right (Yellow Fire Breath), run behind it and strike from behind, you should be able to get a few hits in before it decides to move or change attacks. From there, attack patterns are random and will vary, refer to the right table for how to counter certain attacks.\nAt around 70%-80% HP (May vary), Elden beast will swim away and fly into the air, a ring will then appear around you that closes in, run and then jump over this ring, continue to run as there will be a blast after the ring closes. This ring attack (named Elden Ring Blast on the right side panel) will happen again when Elden Beast is around 30%-40% HP (May vary), instead of 1 ring it will be 3, followed by a blast. These 2 attacks will always happen, unless glitches are used or you somehow manage to kill Elden Beast extremely quickly, for the average player, these 2 attacks will always happen.  \nIf dodged successfully, after most attacks/combos, there will be a window of opportunity to attack Elden Beast as it “stands” still for a few seconds, make sure to get every second out of this window of time before it begins another attack/combo.\nMost Elden Beast attacks can be rolled with relative ease after a few runs before hand, meaning you may be able to conserve healing flasks if you are adamant in your ability to roll it’s attacks, if you aren’t it's recommended to be at or near (80%+) full HP. (This can really only be applied to players who’s HP surpasses 1200-1400 HP)\nAs shown above, Elden Beast is immune to all Status Effects, meaning if you use a weapon that outputs most of its damage through a weapon skill that inflicts a Status Effect, those weapons are ill-advised to use in this fight. Recommended weapons would be high Physical Damaging weapons, such as Greatswords and Colossal Swords, but are not limited to such weapons. \nRecommended Talismans would be any that boost Physical and Holy damage negation, such as the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman and or Heligdrake +2 talisman. Other useful talismans that are advised to use are Crimson Seed Talisman, Green Turtle Talisman, Winged Sword Insignia, Erdtree's Favor +2, and more. Great Runes can and should be used; Godrick’s and Radahn’s are useful if not recommended. Morgott's Great Rune can be generally beneficial but may lead to the player needing up to three +12 Crimson Flask charges to fully heal.\nRecommended Crystal Tears for your physick are Tears that raise Physical damage negation, restore HP, boost stamina recovery, or increase attack damage. Of course, these can and will depend on your build, stats, skills, and preference.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor incantation users, Pest Threads in melee deals heavy damage to large targets such as the Beast who get hit multiple times by each cast, and deals physical damage, which the boss has low resistance to. Burn, O Flame! and Ancient Dragon's Lightning Strike are also good options if cast directly under the Elden Beast's belly.\nFor sorcery users, Shard Spiral works wonders, as the Elden Beast's large model means that it will get hit multiple times by each cast, resulting in large amounts of damage.\nThe Elden Beast has 40% magic damage reduction, but only 10% physical damage reduction, so Rock Sling is also a good spell to use. Loretta's Mastery can be used when the Elden Beast flies into the air as it prepares to surround the player with a golden circle, the arrows even have a moderate (though not guaranteed) chance to break the boss's poise, which cancels the attack.\nFinally, if the player can break the Elden Beast's poise, it will be vulnerable for some seconds, which is the perfect opportunity to unleash Meteorite of Astel combined with Flask of Wondrous Physick with Cerulean Hidden Tear to deal large amounts of physical damage. \n\nElden Beast Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nHand Slam\nSlams its left hand into the ground.\nSimply roll to the left side.\n\nGolden Breath\nRaises its head upward and spews out yellow fire, which spreads in a wide area.\n Stand behind it. Melee users should quickly unlock target lock to avoid camera flail as he stands up and prepares to spew, then re-lock once he finishes.\n\nSword Swing\nBacks a short distance away and swings its sword.\n\nSwimming Sword Swing\nSwims away before returning with a large sword swing.\n\nBlack Hole Teleport\nQuickly swims into a black hole, which teleports it away before exploding.\nWhen you see the cloud run directly away from it.\n\nNebula\nIts hand starts glowing and it swipes in a forward arc, leaving behind a cloud of glittering magic that explodes.\nRun to the sides. \n\nDivine Punishment\nThe beast's left hand will begin shining gold, and it will sweep forward in an attempt to grab the player. If successful, they will be lifted up as if they were crucified, where they will be pierced with several golden spears before being let go.\nDodge or run to the left side.\n\nConcept of Order\nSwims away and begins levitating in the air, forming the symbol of the Elden Ring in the sky. A large ring will begin converging on the target’s position, before ending in a large explosion.\n Run outside of the outer ring, rolling through the enclosing inner circle. On the <50% HP version, running jump 3 times, over each enclosing ring, and then jump one more time to leave the blast radius. The 3-ring version has a more complex symbol in the sky when the Beast floats upward.\n\nGolden WingSpears\nShoots many magical spears from its wings, which chase after the player before crashing into the ground.\n Run in small circles or pick a direction and keep running.\n\nFlying Flame Sword\nFlies through the air shortly before its sword catches on fire, after which it crashes into the ground and swings.\nDodge by rolling forward into the attack. \n\nElden Stars\nSends out a gold projectile that continuously chases its target while spawning smaller homing projectiles that chip away at their health before exploding.\n  Sprint away from Stars, once it gets close, roll back through the stars and sprint the other way. During this time you will also need to worry about other mechanics. Thops' Barrier is an excellent counter to Elden StarsIn the <50% HP version, roll at right angles to avoid the larger star: so, roll forward, then to the right, then directly back, etc. The large star doesn't track fast enough to keep up, but you'll still take chip damage from the smaller ones. Running away from the attack for 5 seconds and then using the Crimsonwhorl Bubbletear physick can nullify the attack. \n\nFlying Wing Spears\nDives into the ground and comes out flying, firing its Wing Spears while doing so.\nSame strategy as above.\n\nSword Swing-Smash\nSwings its sword twice before grabbing the blade and smashing it into the ground.\n\nDivebomb\nFlops on its belly, flies for a short bit, then crashes into the ground.\n\nNebula (Line)\nShoots out a long row of glittering clouds, which then explode soon afterwards.\n At <50% health, he can combine this with other attacks like Flaming Sword Beams, which will be hidden by the cloud. Make sure you always have a clear line of sight on him during this attack.\n\nFlying Sword Crescents\nIts sword catches on fire and it swings forward 4 times, sending a crescent of magic with each swing. The last two swings will be delayed. (The last crescent can diverge and hit your cooperator/Ash summon)\n Doge roll into the Blast. Blocking without a Holy and physical defense shield will hurt. The first two shots are right after each other, so roll and then roll again right away.\n\nFlaming Stab\nSets its sword on fire and stabs the ground, creating an explosion when it pulls the sword out again.\nRun away to avoid the incoming explosion. \n\nSpin Swing\nSpins in a circle and swings its sword.\nDodge through the move and attack it.\n\nFlaming Sword Combo\nSets its sword on fire and alternates between rapid swings and downward stabs before doing a large, angular spin-swing.\n\nWave of Gold\nCharges sword, swings and puts a large amount of damage in the shape of a cone at the player. If caught in the cone, the closer to the tip you are the more damage you take. \nThis attack seems to do multiple chunks of damage, from what I can tell the front of the cone will 1 hit 60 vigor. The only success I've had is dodging half of the damage rolling right as it explodes and being out of the front of the cone more towards the middle.\n\nDive\nDives into the ground and reappears a short distance away.\n Chase it down.\n\nElden Beast Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nArena is covered in water, giving both the player and Elden Beast +10 Fire absorption and -10 Lightning absorption.\nElden Beast's lyrics are mostly untranslatable, this was confirmed by Youtuber and Latin student Antonius Tertius, he contacted the music producers and singers of the game and published the official lyrics and backstage information on Youtube.\nThe Hungarian singer Anna Dinyés is the voice of the soprano the player hears in the Elden Beast theme, this was revealed by Youtuber Antonius Tertius who contacted the singers of Elden Ring.\nBug: If Tarnished is grabbed with Divine Punishment while performing an animation that lowers his postion (f.e. during casting Pest Threads), attack will deal no damage. Grabbed target will not move upwards, but will stay very close to the ground.\nThis boss was nerfed in Patch 1.04 (NG cycle variation only).\n\nElden Beast Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n

QUESTION
Why is it recommended to fight the Elden Beast solo rather than with multiple players?

ANSWER
Fighting Elden Beast solo is recommended over multiple players because having more players increases the boss's HP, making the fight more challenging.
