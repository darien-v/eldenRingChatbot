The Serpent Bow scales primarily with Dexterity and is a good Weapon for long ranged combat. \n\nMalformed bow in the shape of a pair of poisonous snakes. Imbues arrows with poison through pagan magic, revealing its true worth when used with poison-infused arrows. Used by assassins known as the Formless Serpents. \n\nWhere to Find Serpent Bow in Elden Ring\nThe Serpent Bow weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nSerpent Bow can be found by a pool of rot in Abandoned Cave. [Elden Ring Map here]\n\nElden Ring Serpent Bow Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Mighty Shot\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War\nSerpent Bow can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nAdds a base of 15 poison build-up to all arrows. This leaves a visible effect on the arrows. \n\nBest paired with Serpent Arrows for faster poisoning. Especially effective when using its skill, Mighty Shot.\nThe poison inflicted is not deadly poison, despite bearing similar design elements to the Serpentbone Blade and the Venomous Fang. See (Poison) for more information. \nThe buildup of Scarlet Rot from Rotbone Arrows is not affected by this bow, since Scarlet Rot doesn't scale.\n\nThe Arcane scaling on this weapon does not affect damage. The arcane scaling only affects the build-up of poison, bleed, and sleep passive effects of arrows. This bow is mostly advantageous with builds that integrate medium to high arcane. \n\nDeals similar damage to the Longbow, and shares the same Weapon Skill. Can be a potential substitute for it.\nAt low levels the Black Bow or any Light Bow with Barrage may be more effective for quickly applying status buildup (at short range).\n\nSell Value:   100.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

QUESTION
Why is the Serpent Bow particularly advantageous for builds that integrate medium to high arcane, despite its arcane scaling not affecting damage directly?

ANSWER
The Serpent Bow is advantageous for arcane builds because its arcane scaling affects the build-up of poison, bleed, and sleep passive effects of arrows, making it effective with status-inducing arrows even though it does not directly impact damage.
