These hunched skeleton dress in lace and ride a ghostly boat. It steers its vessel and attacks the player with a large horn and the aid of undead Skeletons. They are optional bosses, as players don't need to defeat them in order to advance in Elden Ring.\nWhere to find Tibia Mariner in Elden Ring\nTibia Mariner can be found in:\n\nSummonwater Village [More Info] [Map Link]\nLiurnia of the Lakes [More Info] [Map Link]\nWyndham Ruins [More Info] [Map Link]\nMountaintops of the Giants [More Info] [Map Link]\n\nTibia Mariner Combat information\n\nStance: 80\nParryable: No\nImmune to critical attacks. Breaking its stance will only stun it briefly\n Undead type\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: -40\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 40\nHoly: -40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Tibia Mariner Boss Guide\n\nTibia Mariner Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Tibia Mariner:\n\nStay on Torrent throughout the battle to more easily follow the Tibia Mariner when it teleports.\nUse a spirit ash that can help you distract the Skeletons, like the Lone Wolf Ashes.\n\nMelee Users\nYee Haw: Stay mounted on Torrent, run in for a few hits, then run away again. The Skeletons are slow enough that you won't need to worry about them, and the Tibia Mariner's attacks are slow enough that you probably won't get hit often.\nSlow and Steady: If you're fighting on foot, focus on damaging the Tibia Mariner itself and try to avoid getting hit by the Skeletons. Hit the boss a few times and then dodge out of the way when it starts attacking. Keep repeating this, staying to its side or behind it if you can. The Crashing Wave attack will kill Skeletons as well, which can help control the crowd.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nStay on horseback and keep back when attacking. The Tibia Mariner moves slowly and doesn't have any way to punish ranged attacks other than its allies, which move slowly in their own right as well. If they start crowding you, run to the other side of the boss and attack from there.\n\nTibia Mariner Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nBoat Slam \nSlowly raises the bow of its boat, then drops it from a medium height. This attack has very good tracking and will hit you if you try to strafe\nRun away a few paces—this attack doesn't have a wide radius\n\nCrashing Wave\nRaises its hand above its head with a green glow while the boat rises high into the air on a wave, then crashes down doing a large amount of damage to everything around it\nRun away and wait for the attack to finish\n\nHorn Splash\nDips its horn to one side and then whips it forward, splashing damaging water to its side\nCircle to the stern of the boat and keep attacking\n\nHorn Swing\nSwings its horn to one side\nRoll towards the stern of the boat\n\nVertical Horn\nHolds its horn vertically in front of it for a long time, then brings it down in front of it. The hitbox on this attack is surprisingly small\nStay towards the back of the boat and keep attacking\n\nTeleport\nWill teleport to a different location after fading away. Resummons Skeletons at target\nThey can be hit while they are teleporting\n\nSummon Allies\nBlows its horn flat along the boat, summoning additional Skeletons to attack you\nThis doesn't do any damage itself, so you can attack freely during it\n\nTibia Mariner Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThey always drop Deathroot, which signifies their control over Those Who Live in Death.\nThey also occasionally summon a Giant Skeleton (Spirit).\nKnown as Bonebeckoner Mariner in 1.00 version of the game.\n\nTibia Mariner Combo Chart \n\n Tibia Mariner  Summonwater Village  \n\nDrops\n 2,400DeathrootSkeletal Militiaman Ashes\n\nHP\n3,176\n\nElden Ring Tibia Mariner Boss (Summonwater Village)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Summonwater Village Outskirts\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nTibia Mariner Location\nThe Tibia Mariner moves around the pond in Summonwater Village, directly northeast of the Summonwater Village Outskirts Site of Grace. [Map Link]\nTibia Mariner Combat information\n\nHealth: 3,176 HP \nDefense: 103\nDrops  2,400, Deathroot, Skeletal Militiaman Ashes\nThis Tibia Mariner summons Skeletons\nNPC Summons: D, Hunter of the Dead. Speak to him first just outside Summonwater Village before this encounter and he available to help you during this fight.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.
