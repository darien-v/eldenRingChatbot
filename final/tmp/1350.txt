CONTEXT
\n\n Sorcery Scaling \n\nEffect\nThe degree to which sorceries increase in power.\n\nSorcery Scaling is one of the Statistics in Elden Ring. It is a special Offensive Stat that is used in the calculation that determines how much damage is dealt in Combat by Sorceries and is affected primarily by your equipment.\n\nElden Ring Sorcery Scaling Guide\nSorcery Scaling is a special type of damage stat that can be found on Glintstone Staves. The higher this statistic, the higher the damage of the sorcery used with the staff. Sorcery Scaling does not increase the duration of buffs or utility sorceries, it only affects damage values.\n\nSorcery Scaling Calculations\n\nInfo to be added\n\nSorcery Scaling and Weapons\nGlintstone Staves possess the Sorcery Scaling stat. The value of this stat usually increases in proportion to item upgrade level and Intelligence, although some glintstone staves will also scale with other attributes.\n\nThe Demi-Human Queen's Staff has a notably high base value for Sorcery Scaling that increases as the staff is upgraded, but it scales much worse with intelligence than most other staves.\nThe Gelmir Glintstone Staff and Prince of Death's Staff will increase Sorcery Scaling with both Intelligence and Faith, but have lower intelligence scaling than most staves. The Staff of the Guilty has no Intelligence scaling at all, and scales solely with Faith.\nThe Albinauric Staff will increase Sorcery Scaling with both Intelligence and Arcane, but has lower intelligence scaling than most staves.\nThe Meteorite Staff increases Sorcery Scaling with intelligence like most staves, but cannot be upgraded.\n\nElden Ring Sorcery Scaling Notes & Tips\n\nThe Sorcery Scaling stat is used solely to determine damage values of sorceries. It will not affect other features of sorceries such as duration or range, and it will not affect incantations.\nOnly the Sorcery Scaling stat of the staff used to cast the spell is used in its calculations. Another staff may be held in the off-hand to provide buffs to particular types of spells, but its Sorcery Scaling value will not be used.\n\nDamage Types in Elden Ring\n\nCritical Damage  ♦  Fire Damage  ♦  Holy Damage  ♦  Incant Scaling  ♦  Lightning Damage  ♦  Magic Damage  ♦  Pierce Damage  ♦  Slash Damage  ♦  Special Weaknesses  ♦  Standard Damage  ♦  Strike Damage\n\n
