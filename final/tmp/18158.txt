Map Link. You can find the solution to the puzzle on the town's page.\n\nMiquella's Haligtree Canopy \n\nYou have to be incredibly careful when traversing Miquella’s Haligtree. The enemies here have good range and any misstep, poor jump, or even a simple knockback from an enemy can send you falling off the tree and to your doom. Having ranged attacks and skills helps immensely for this area, and holy damage negation is great for weathering the projectiles. After arriving at Miquella’s Haligtree, immediately turn around. You’ll find a corpse sitting at the branch’s tip that has a Stonesword Key on them. Turn back around and move forward to get to a Site of Grace. \nStarting at the site of grace, face North. On the right, you'll see a ladder with a enclosed gazebo on the left of it. The next site of grace is in that gazebo, so your goal is to proceed through the treetops until you reach the ladder and climb down. (See first image below)\n\nLook east and you'll find three Oracle Envoys at different levels of the branch's edge that you can sneak up to and knock off the tree. At the first Oracle Envoy, you can turn right and follow the branch to get to a corpse that has three Sacramental Buds. After knocking off the third Oracle Envoy, look eastward and jump down to the branch close to you. Ahead, is a Large Oracle Envoy. He will knock you off, so quickly close the distance and prevent him from attacking by staggering him out of his attacks. You'll find a corpse with a Golden Rune (10) right where he was standing.\n\nTurn left and follow the branch northeast. You'll see three Oracle Envoys on the branch above and one patrolling the one you are currently on. If you can snipe them from far away, for example with Loretta's Greatbow, it will help you navigate this area. Otherwise, sneak forward and jump down to the wide tree branch to your southeast that's patrolled by Giant Ants. If you get spotted at this point, the Oracle Envoys will spit bubbles that can 2-hit you. Facing south, looking towards where this wide branch splits, head up the left side to get out of their range. There's a Large Oracle Envoy here that, as long as you don't attack, will not notice you. You can safely deal with any Giant Ants you've alerted here and pick up a Golden Rune (10) on a corpse. You'll be able to spot an item in the east, but we'll grab that when it's safer.\n\nOnce that's all dealt with, you can go back to where this branch splits and instead go up the right side where you'll find a corpse with a Dappled Cured Meat. Head back down the branch facing north, and take the first right. This branch leads up to where those three Oracle Envoys were sniping you from. You can now close the gap and defeat these enemies, making navigating this part of the haligtree safer.\n\nBacktrack to the left split of the branch where you found the Golden Rune (10) and when facing south, take the left detour branch towards where the item we saw earlier is. If you have any ranged attacks, it's worth taking care of the Oracle Envoy and the Giant Poison Flower here as their attacks can knock you off of this thin branch. Follow this branch and when you get to the end, turn north-east and jump down to the closest branch. Follow this branch around and you'll reach that corpse you saw at the tip of the branch containing a Stonesword Key. Other items you can find on your way include two Aeonian Butterflies, a Preserving Boluses, and three Fire Grease.\n\nNavigate your way back to the thick branch where the Giant Ants were found. Facing north, continue making your way down the branch finding four Warming Stones on a corpse lying on some mushrooms. If you turn around and go up the thinner branch to the right, you'll find the Prattling Pate "My Beloved". From the corpse with the Warming Stones, you should be able to see a Giant Oracle Envoy in the far distance. Get ready to make a break for him because he will spot you from a mile away, and he will shoot 5 homing bubbles at a time to destroy you. From the corpse, you can sneak towards the first set of large pink mushrooms you see on your right. If you look down you'll be able to see a thin branch you can jump down to.\nAfter jumping down, sneaking will no longer help you as the Oracle Envoy should have spotted you. Turn left at the juncture and follow the path of the branch, rolling past the Poison Flowers and dodging the incoming bubbles, until you get to the Oracle Envoy. Because of how the branches are formed and sloped, you can angle yourself to where he shoots his bubbles at the floor and attack him during his downtime. If you're walking up at him to deal melee attacks, be particularly careful of when he jumps up and slams the ground as this move can potentially knock you off of the tree. \n\nAfter you've defeated him, turn around and look for a branch going upwards. You'll see two Oracle Envoys, a Large Envoy, and a Giant one all with their backs turned. Carefully pick them off, then at the top of this branch, you can collect the Oracle Envoy Ashes. Turn back, follow the branch southwest where you'll find a corpse on the platform that has a Lost Ashes of War. You can now backtrack to the thick branch where there are two corpses with items under the branch he was standing on, one of which contains ten Flaming Bolts and another with a Numen's Rune. Continue facing north and making your way down the branch and you'll get to a platform with a ladder going down. After heading down the ladder, you'll find a non-functioning lever to the right. This will be used for a shortcut that links to the end of this area. Continue forward and you'll find the Haligtree Town Site of Grace.\n\nMiquella's Haligtree Town\n\nFrom this point on, navigating the tree is less dangerous, but do note that falling off the platforms and buildings into the void is still fatal. As you make your way down the steps ahead, a Misbegotten will come rushing at you. Another two can be found distracted on the next platform. Note that failing to backstab the closest distracted Misbegotten will attract the attention of a more powerful one on the platform above you, and they will jump down and attack. From here there are two ways forward - up the ladder or further down the steps.\nNote that from the ladder, if you look off to the West, you can see the next site of grace.\n\nHead up the ladder first, where you'll find a Misbegotten ravaging a corpse. To the right, you'll see three scarlet rot zombies peering over the edge. It doesn't seem that any of these enemies will notice you until you attack them, so dispose of them however you please. The body here has two Rot Grease on it and if you turn to face where the zombies were facing earlier, you'll see another platform with an item guarded by a Leonine Misbegotten (provided you didn't aggro it from below). The item here is a Pearldrake Talisman (+2) and once you've grabbed it, head back down the ladder.\n\nContinue down the stairs where you'll see some Misbegotten seemingly praying to the skies. Beware of the zombie ambush when you reach the base of the stairs though. Head through the building to the right, again being careful of a zombie ambush as you approach the building, and you'll see an item on a corpse right ahead. Before picking it up, take care of the axe-wielding Misbegotten around the corner, or it'll charge you while you're trying to loot. Once you've looted the corpse for a Smithing Stone [8], continue heading down the steps where you'll find another two Misbegotten and a corpse with six Hefty Beast Bones on it. You can also choose to jump down from where the zombie waiting to ambush you were to the lower floor of the building, skipping the zombie group and the axe-wielding Misbegotten on the top floor. Before you leave through the gaping hole in the building, head out the southern door, where you'll get to a ledge with a Golden Rune [13] on a corpse.\n\nBack through the destroyed wall, there's a ladder going down. If you have any ranged attacks, you might want to get rid of the Giant Poison Flower you can see from the top of the ladder because once you descend it, you'll find that there are two Giant Poison Flowers here sitting next to each other. Alternatively, you can jump across to the platform with a ladder going up to the right and a wooden bridge to the left. If you decided to go down and kill the flowers, head up the ladder that used to be behind the rightmost flower, and head in the building to your left through the open window. If you turn to face the southeast, you'll see the aforementioned bridge, with a corpse holding five Fire Grease, connecting this building to a platform with the ladder going up. There isn't much at the top besides a hoard of zombies that you can farm, so once you've taken the item off of the corpse, turn around and head back to where you came from.\n\nAfter emerging from the building, you'll see a large Misbegotten standing guard in front of a statue. Be careful as you exit the building, because two other misbegottens will ambush you, alerting the large enemy. You can back up in the building to manage the fight better. Defeat the group of enemies and grab the Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone in front of the statue.\n\nIf you're finding this to be difficult and far away from a site of grace; while dodging enemies, you can run out the building, into the next building to the west/southwest, run straight out of this building, turn south to find a wooden bridge, run across the bridge to the Haligtree Town Plaza Site site of grace. Backtrack to gather the following items.\n\nEnter the doorway into the building in the west/southwest. In this building, you can go either straight ahead or to the left. To the left, you'll find a corpse (guarded by enemies) hanging off the ledge with a Somber Smithing Stone [8] on it, be mindful of the ambushing zombies and a misbegotten enemy. Straight ahead, you'll cross a bridge that takes you to the Haligtree Town Plaza Site of Grace and a Golden Rune [12].\n\nFacing south, jump down to the roof of the building and collect the Smithing Stone [6] from the corpse, then turn around to go to the branch with the Giant Ants protecting a corpse with four Aeonian Butterflies on it. Turn back toward the building on the roof you jumped off, and head inside. There'll be three scarlet rot zombies and a corpse holding a Somber Smithing Stone [9].\n\nWhen you emerge from the building, turn hard right and defeat the Lesser Spirit-Caller Snail here. There's another snail straight ahead from the building and another to the right of that snail, hiding in the corner of the roof. You'll want to have them defeated before doing this next part. After looting the Golden Rune [10] off of the corpse here, face southeast and head to the tip of the roof. The jump onto the other roof is difficult but manageable. If you, however, can't make the jump, you will still survive by simply landing on the platform the building is standing on.\n\nIf you jumped onto the platform, head up the ladder, be careful of the zombie that may ambush you as you approach it, and take the zombies up here out to grab the Smithing Stone [6]. Taking a ladder behind (north), you will reach a roof you intended to jump onto. Now jump to the roof to southwest direction. Facing north, you will see a room slightly below the roof you are standing. This will net you Viridian Amber Medallion+2, found in a chest.\n\nJump back to the platform and this time head down the ladder to the east, where you'll find you can continue east, or go west. Through the western doorway is a corpse with a Sacramental Bud and a Crimson Teardrop Scarab each guarded by a large Misbegotten in their little rooms. The way forward is to the east, into the little walkway.\n\nAfter defeating the two Misbegotten here, you'll find a doorway leading back outside to your left. There'll be a Battlemage just across the way inside the gazebo, and one patrolling the bridge on the right. Take these two mages out to safely cross the bridges. In front of the gazebo, you can loot a Smithing Stone [7] from the corpse, and inside you'll find a Smithing Stone [8]. If you turn around to face the bridge you just came from, you'll see two other bridges on either side. Up the leftmost bridge is a gazebo with a Hero's Rune [4] on a corpse. When you've grabbed that, cross the rightmost bridge and take the lift up. This takes you back to the Haligtree Town Site of Grace and activates the shortcut here.\nAfter activating that, and resting at the Site of Grace if needed, head back to the gazebo through the shortcut and you'll be able to sneak past the Battlemages this time if they're back. Cross the northeastern bridge to get to a large, open courtyard.\n\nMiniboss: Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree\n\nWhen you walk into the courtyard, Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree spawns at the far end. This fight is relatively straightforward, with easy-to-read, telegraphed movements and attacks. Her biggest strength is her mobility on her horse, allowing her to close the distance between her and ranged or magic users. This boss fight is made even easier when fighting with any Spirit Ash to distract her from you. The biggest skill to look out for is Loretta's Greatbow, where she channels a large magic greatbow to shoot a powerful homing shot at you. This skill gets upgraded to Loretta's Mastery when she's under 50% health, where instead of one magic bolt, she fires four. This skill has a relatively long charging time, and you'll be able to tell when she's about to cast it when she draws her halberd like a bow. When you see this happen, create distance between you and the boss, and if dodging to the side isn't working for you, try dodging into it. Other than that, dodge her attacks and hit her in between, and you'll occasionally be able to stagger her for extra hits.\nLoretta's defeat nets you 200,000 Runes, Loretta's Mastery, and her weapon, Loretta's War Sickle. The Haligtree Promenade Site of Grace is also now available where she spawned.\n\nGetting to Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree\nDefeating Loretta opens up the fog door to the north. Simply follow the path down the stairs, then down the ladder. Before going into the room to the right, head up the stairs next to it, where at the top you'll find a chest with an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone. Head back down and take the lift in the room you passed by to emerge into Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree.\n\nPrevious: Crumbling Farum Azula\n\nNext: Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree\n\nMiquella's Haligtree Map\n\nTop Level\n\nMiddle Level\n\n1st Lower Level\n\n2nd Lower Level\n\nMiquella's Haligtree Videos\n\nSpeed Run Walkthrough\nAfter reaching Miquella's Haligtree from Ordina, Liturgical Town, immediately turn around and grab the Stonesword Key off of the corpse. Turn back around and head forward to interact with a Site of Grace. Continue forward, sneaking past the three Oracle Envoys on the left. At the third Oracle Envoy, look east and jump down onto the branch. Defeat the tall Oracle Envoy here to keep him from knocking you off and collect the Golden Rune (10) from where he was standing.\nTurn left and jump down to the thick branch with Giant Ants on it. Facing south, head up the left side of the thick branch to get out of the attack range of some Oracle Envoys that may be attacking you and to deal with any Giant Ants you've alerted. If you're feeling adventurous, you can run up the thin branch to the right when facing north and follow the branch left, circling until you get the Stonesword Key off of a corpse hanging off the tip of a branch.\nFacing north, head down the thick branch until you get to a corpse with 4 Warming Stones lying on some large pink mushrooms. A bit forward and to the right, you'll be able to jump down to a thin branch. Follow the branch left and you'll get to a large Oracle Envoy. Defeat him and you'll be able to access a corpse slouching under a nearby statue that has a Lost Ashes of War on it.\nHead back to the wide tree branch and head down it until you find a ladder. Take the ladder down and continue forward, where you'll find another Site of Grace. Continue forward and head down the stairs. Turn right to enter a building and loot the Smithing Stone (8) off of the corpse here. Continue down the stairs and head down the ladder here. Defeat the two Giant Poison Flowers here and head up the next ladder.\nAt the top of the ladder, steal the Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone from under the large Misbegotten and run through the doorway in the west. In the left room, you'll find a Somber Smithing Stone (8) and right ahead, you'll find the Haligtree Town Plaza Site of Grace.\nFrom this Site of Grace, jump down to the roof in the south and collect the Smithing Stone (6). If you jump down and into the building, you'll find a Somber Smithing Stone (9). In the area ahead, you'll find three Lesser Spirit-Caller Snails that you should defeat. After defeating them, face southeast and head to the roof's tip, then jump down to the platform in front. \nHead up the ladder here and grab the Smithing Stone (6) from the corpse. Climb down the ladder to the east then continue heading eastward. Through the building, there'll be a door to the left that opens to a bridge leading to a gazebo. Run past the Battlemages here and collect the Smithing Stones (7) & (8) on the corpses by the gazebo. Facing the bridge you just took, go up the bridge to its right and head up the lift to activate the shortcut.\nHead back down the lift, then cross the northeastern bridge to get to a large open courtyard. Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree spawns here and upon defeat, drops Loretta's Mastery and Loretta's War Sickle. Interact with the Site of Grace that spawns after her defeat, and head through the doorway behind it. Follow the path and before heading down the lift, climb the stairs next to its room to grab an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone on the roof of the building. Going down the lift takes you to Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree.\n\nGallery\n\nLegacy Dungeons\n\nCrumbling Farum Azula  ♦  Elphael Brace of the Haligtree  ♦  Leyndell Royal Capital (Legacy Dungeon)  ♦  Raya Lucaria Academy  ♦  Stormveil Castle  ♦  Volcano Manor\n\n
