If you are a seasoned gamer, you are likely aware of the notorious FromSoftware Title's difficulty and Elden Ring is no different.\n\nIts overall difficulty is most commonly a source of debate but overall the consensus would be hard to punish. Expect to die a lot, especially in your first play-through as you are learning the ropes. All of the player's and enemies' moveset were intricately designed. To the point that constant calculation is required from the player's end. Split second decision makings often encountered especially in major boss fights. Decisions that range from basic attacking, ability usage, dodging, and blocking to advance once such inventory management, etc. Decisions that heavily affect each battle's outcomes directly affect one's progress. Ergo, we have created this page to assist newcomers and intermediate players alike and provide aid in understanding the mechanics of Elden Ring's Combat. Mastering Elden Ring's Combat is everything thus, let deep dive into it and enjoy the process.\n\nMaster the Basics\nIt is important to understand and master the basics of combat in Elden Ring. Knowing one's basic repertoire is the key to understanding even the hardest mechanics or features of Combat. In this section, we will be listing each of the player's basic movesets or the actions they can do in combat. Each action has its strengths and weaknesses and understanding these plays a pivotal role in the process. Basic movesets such as Regular Attacks, Dodging, Blocking, and more. After mastering the basic foundation of combat, we will cover the rest of the advanced techniques that a player can take advantage of in the later sections.\n\nRegular Attacks In Elden Ring\nIn Elden Ring combat, melee attacks form the core aspect for most classes, excluding those focused on spellcasting. You have the opportunity to select from an extensive range of weapons, each possessing unique traits and gameplay styles. Engage in confrontations with the most formidable warriors inhabiting the Lands Between. Enhance your strength by two-handing a weapon or unleash powerful attacks by wielding two weapons of the same type. It is worth noting that each type of weapon has its movesets to master thus, finding your playstyle and mastering it is a must. Understanding the gameplay that you want to achieve dictates the weapons and abilities that you want to build for your character.\n\nUsing Spells in Elden Ring\nWithin the Lands Between, an abundance of magic courses through, awaiting those who aspire to attain the status of Elden Lord. Those with profound Intelligence among the Tarnished can wield a Glintstone Staff to cast Sorceries, whereas the Faithful rely on Sacred Seals to unleash their Incantations. Spells possess a diverse array of effects, ranging from inflicting damage upon adversaries to augmenting your power, mending injuries, or bestowing special advantages and abilities. When you find yourself resting at a Site of Grace, exercise caution in selecting the spells you wish to commit to memory, ensuring you acquire the necessary power and adaptability. Players will have a vast array of spell selections in Elden Ring. Each of these Spells has unique effects that can aid the player in various situations.\n\nUsing Ashes of War in Elden Ring\nIn Elden Ring, each weapon possesses a unique ability that can be utilized. While numerous skills are designated as special attacks, others aid in mitigating damage, executing evasive maneuvers, or enhancing your capabilities in diverse manners. Moreover, by obtaining Ashes of War scattered across the Lands Between, you gain the ability to modify the skills of many weapons. Feel free to experiment and combine different skills to discover the ideal configuration that suits your playstyle! Ashes of War are a personal favorite. Adding a flair to my build is a must. Carefully understanding each Ash of War's characteristics will yield great results as players can perform better depending on their current situation. These abilities will have their section to tackle more pointers about it later on.\n\nSpirit Ashes in Elden Ring\nDuring your adventure, you will encounter the remnants of spirits known as ashes, which can be summoned to assist in combat. These spirits often manifest as defeated enemies scattered across the Lands Between. Along your path, you will encounter a fellow Tarnished who possesses the ability to enhance your summoned spirits. With her guidance, these spirits can grow in strength, enabling them to accompany you in even the most daunting trials you face. An intricate system that may provide companionship to players and we will have a dedicated section that explores the basics of Spirit Ashes.\n\nStamina is Everything\nDealing combination attacks, dodging, blocking, sprinting and even spells consumes stamina. Stamina plays a pivotal role in Elden Ring. In my opinion, Stamina is the holy grail stat, especially for melee users. Treating Stamina as an offensive stat is indeed a good perspective. Increasing offensive stats like Faith, Dexterity, or Strength is a good way to improve your overall damage per second. However, if one will neglect the importance of Endurance, the character build that you are hoping for will likely fail in most cases. Your rolls, shield blocks, and the number of regular attacks depend on how much stamina or Endurance Points a Tarnished has. Balancing your stats is a must especially during your first playthrough so you will not end up dying in most cases since you do not have decent stamina points to move around on the battlefield.\n\nMastering Weapon Types\nPlayers can explore a plethora of Weapons in Elden Ring. As mentioned previously, you need to find your specific playstyle as it depends on your personal preference or the build that you are going for. An example would be, Katanas for decent weapon attack speed and great attack power or weapon scaling while having a good range, or Colossal Weapons with very slow attack speed but having an immense Attack Power due to its superb Attack Stats Scaling that can crush foes in few amounts of blows. A spear that has magnificent thrust attacks with great range, making players safe from melee attacks. These are just a few examples of weapon types and a lot more are in store for anyone who wants to dive into it.\n\nBlocking Attacks in Elden Ring\nBy equipping a Shield, you can raise your guard to effectively defend against incoming attacks. The amount of damage mitigated relies on the stats of your shield, but with perseverance, it is possible to acquire a shield that protects against all forms of Physical Damage. Nevertheless, exercise caution as blocking attacks depletes your Stamina. If your Stamina is fully exhausted, you will be immobilized and vulnerable for a brief but crucial period. While Shields are the best equipment when blocking attacks, other weapons and Spells may be used to guard and mitigate incoming damage.\n\nDodging Attacks in Elden Ring\nTo ensure your survival in combat, the key is to evade incoming attacks rather than absorb them. Employ the dodge roll technique to swiftly maneuver in any direction, evading imminent danger. Utilize the momentary invincibility granted during the roll to pass through incoming attacks unscathed, positioning yourself to retaliate against audacious assailants. In addition to the fundamental dodge roll, Elden Ring provides various other methods to evade attacks, such as jumping over them or employing special skills for defense.\n\nParry in Elden Ring\nTarnished can execute a parry maneuver, nullifying incoming attacks and exposing your adversary to a critical strike. In contrast to past Souls games, certain bosses in Elden Ring require multiple successful parries to unleash a single critical hit. Nonetheless, an extensive assortment of parry skills exists, enabling you to enhance your parrying capabilities. These skills offer options such as long-range parrying or even the ability to parry spells, providing you with diverse ways to master the art of parrying.\n\nStealth in Elden Ring\nNot every confrontation requires a direct approach. Elden Ring incorporates stealth mechanics that enable you to navigate around encounters you wish to evade. Adopt a low crouch to minimize noise, take cover in tall grass or behind substantial objects to remain undetected, and uncover spells, skills, and equipment scattered throughout the Lands Between to maintain stealth. When the time is right to unveil yourself, position yourself behind an unsuspecting enemy to deliver a devastating critical strike. Enemies unaware of your presence will always be susceptible to heightened damage, providing you with a significant advantage.\n\nJump Capability in Elden Ring\nThe jump button in Elden Ring serves a dual purpose, not only facilitating exploration but also introducing an additional element to combat. With powerful jump attacks, players can effectively bridge the gap between opponents and inflict significant stance damage. Furthermore, jumps can be utilized to evade low-to-the-ground attacks, providing invulnerability to the legs and torso while airborne. However, caution is advised, as sustaining a hit while in mid-air will result in being forcefully knocked down. As mentioned, The Jump ability may be taken advantage of thus, reminding oneself that you have this ability is a must since it is easy to forget it exists, especially when trying to avoid dodging different types of attacks in Elden Ring.\n\nRoll Attack\nRoll Attacks is an underrated moveset in Elden Ring. In the early game, players will likely not see its use or effectiveness in battle. However in major Bosses, when optimizing fights while doing advanced techniques such as I-Framing, roll attacks can be valuable assets. Roll Attacks grants the player the ability to transition from evading incoming attacks to an offensive stance and deal attack combinations.\n\nWatch Your Health Points\nLike in other games, watching your health points should be a priority especially when having your first playthrough. Once the HP reaches zero, your character dies. Increasing your Vitality may provide more HP in the process Vigor plays a vital role during your first playthrough, the more HP you have, the higher the chances that you will survive a fight especially when trying to master Bosses. As you master Elden Ring's Combat, you will have the option to reduce the points allotted in your Vitality and put it to offensive stats like Strength or Dexterity.\n\nKick in Elden Ring\nKicking targets in Elden Ring has benefits that a player can take advantage of. The kick's damage is abysmally low however, its main purpose is to break the enemy's stance, especially the ones who use a shield. Kicking guarding enemies will have their guard broken and be staggered, open for attacks. Knowing your enemy's loadout is also beneficial and once a shield user surfaces, you will know how to respond and counter these enemies.\n\nWhat is FP in Elden Ring?\nIn the world of Elden Ring, FP, or Focus Points, is a vital statistic among the various stats that define your character. These stats determine your character's abilities, strengths, and vulnerabilities, both in combat and in other situations. FP specifically represents an energy resource that powers your spells and skills. FP is categorized as one of the base stats, which means it is directly influenced by how you allocate your main attributes during character creation. As you distribute your main attributes, such as strength, dexterity, intelligence, and faith, your FP will be affected accordingly. This allocation of attributes plays a significant role in shaping your character's overall capabilities.\nManaging FP effectively becomes crucial as you progress through the game. It acts as a finite resource that governs the usage of your spells and skills. Every time you cast a spell or utilize a skill, it consumes a portion of your FP. Therefore, it's important to balance the usage of your abilities, ensuring that you have enough FP to unleash your most potent spells and skills when facing formidable foes. Remember, strategic management of FP is key. Utilize your spells and skills judiciously, balancing their usage with the regeneration of FP through various means, such as resting at bonfires or utilizing specific items.\n\nElden Ring Combat Quick Navigation\nAshes of War Basics  ♦  Fundamentals of Spells   ♦  Spirit Ashes Overview  ♦  Weapon Types Overview  ♦  Starting Classes Overview\n\nElden Ring Ashes of War Basics\nAshes of War are abilities or weapon skills in the game that plays a vital role in a player's progress.

It is worth noting that Remembrance Weapons and Legendary Weapons boast unique skill animations that are a must-try, These weapons improve Character Builds drastically.\nWeapon Damage Types in Elden Ring\nIn Elden Ring, every weapon possesses one or more types of damage. For example, the Longswords inflict both Standard and Pierce Damage. This is because its regular attacks are classified as Standard Damage, while its thrust attack deals with Piercing Damage. Understanding the damage types of your chosen weapon can be advantageous, as certain enemies may have weaknesses or resistances to specific types of damage.\nMoreover, in Elden Ring, it is possible to modify the damage type of many weapons by inserting Ashes of War into them through the Ashes of War menu at a Site of Grace. When you select your weapon in this menu, it will display the available Ashes of War that you can use on your weapon, based on the ones you currently possess. This allows you to customize the damage type of your weapon to better suit the weaknesses of your adversaries.\n\nHow Does Weapon Scaling Work?\nSimilar to previous games developed by From Software, Elden Ring features weapons that have specific stat requirements. These requirements must be met in order to effectively wield the weapon. For instance, if you don't meet the requirements, you won't be able to use the weapon's special skill. Therefore, it's important to plan accordingly and seek out weapons that match your abilities. Scaling refers to how much damage a weapon gains based on your investment in a particular stat, such as Strength or Dexterity. Elden Ring follows a similar approach to the Souls franchise in grading scaling with letters. "S" is the best scaling, followed by "A," "B," "C," "D," and "E."\nIn simple terms, the higher the letter grade, the more damage you will deal by focusing on the corresponding scaling stat. Some weapons have multiple scaling stats, so it's crucial to pay attention to these and prioritize the ones that provide the most damage per attribute point invested. It's possible to alter the scaling on weapons by using the Ash of War, which depends on the Whetblades you have found. For example, using the Heavy Infusion will remove all scaling except for Strength (STR) and enhance the strength scaling on the weapon.\nBasics of Weapon Upgrades\nIn Elden Ring, upgrading weapons is done at the Smithing Table. At this location, you can utilize the Runes and Smithing Stones you've collected to upgrade regular weapons. Additionally, Somber Smithing Stones are used to upgrade unique weapons. When a weapon is upgraded, it progresses from its base version to the "+1" version, indicating that it has been upgraded once. This upgrade not only enhances the weapon's damage but can also improve its overall scaling in certain cases. For example, upgrading the Longsword to Longsword +1 enhances its Strength scaling from D to C, resulting in increased damage from investing in Strength.\nUnlike the Souls games, Elden Ring does not involve the use of "Gems" or other materials to alter a weapon's damage type. Instead, Ashes of War and Whetblades found throughout the game are utilized. These can be added or removed from your weapon, enabling you to experiment with different versions of your current weapon and discover the one that suits your preferences the best.\n\nElden Ring Weapon Types\n\nWeapon Type\nDescription\n\nDaggers\nDaggers possess a notably limited reach but compensate for it with their rapid attack speed and remarkable Critical Damage. These qualities enable them to execute devastating backstabs and ripostes. If you intend to adopt a stealthy playstyle or frequently employ backstabs and parries, daggers can be an excellent choice of weapon for you.\n\nStraight Swords\nStraight Swords in Elden Ring are dependable weapons that strike a balance between slashing and thrusting attacks, enabling you to deal significant damage to enemies and bosses. These swords are among the more user-friendly weapons in the game, making them accessible for players of varying skill levels. They pair particularly well with shields, as they allow for swift follow-up attacks immediately after blocking, creating openings for counterattacks.\n\nGreatswords\nGreatswords possess the potential to deal tremendous amounts of damage, but they come with a trade-off in terms of mobility. Care must be taken by players wielding these weapons, as their slower swings can leave them vulnerable to enemy and boss attacks. The use of greatswords involves a high-risk, high-reward dynamic, where strategic timing and precision play crucial roles. However, their immense power allows for the satisfying ability to "pancake" many enemies, swiftly incapacitating them and enabling players to emerge from the encounter unscathed.\n\nColossal Swords\nColossal Swords take the place of Ultra Greatswords found in the Souls series. As their name suggests, these swords are oversized, often surpassing the height of the Tarnished (the player characters) themselves. Despite their weight and slower swing speed compared to other swords, Colossal Swords offer the advantage of an extended reach and deliver tremendous damage. Properly wielding these massive weapons typically demands a substantial investment in Strength. If a player falls slightly short of the strength requirements, resorting to two-handed wielding can help compensate for the shortfall.\n\nThrusting Swords\nThrusting Swords find a middle ground between delivering moderate damage, quick attacks, and providing ample reach, as they puncture and slash enemies. Take it as how Rapiers behave in other titles.\n\nHeavy Thrusting Swords\nHeavy Thrusting Swords specialize in piercing attacks and excel at countering or following up on enemy strikes. Despite their additional weight, these swords deliver increased physical attack power while still allowing players to wield them alongside a shield.\n\nCurved Swords\nCurved Swords are designed for swift slashing attacks, enabling players to deal damage to adversaries while maintaining their mobility. These swords possess the advantage of swift attack speed, surpassing that of numerous other melee weapons in Elden Ring. This makes them particularly effective against agile and nimble opponents. Similar to Thrusting Swords, Curved Swords offer a unique back-step feint. When charging a heavy attack, pressing the Dodge button cancels the attack and executes a back-step attack instead.\n\nCurved Greatswords\nCurved Greatswords excel in delivering powerful slash-based attacks, enabling wielders to unleash significant damage upon enemies. However, these weapons come at the cost of decreased mobility, leaving the wielder susceptible to counterattacks from both regular enemies and imposing bosses.\n\nKatanas\nKatanas are renowned for their proficiency in mid-range combat, excelling in both slashing and thrusting attacks. Additionally, they possess the ability to inflict the Hemorrhage status effect, commonly known as Bleed, which can cause substantial damage over time. The unique moveset of katanas entices many players to opt for this weapon type.\n\nTwinblades\nTwinblades present a challenging aspect in their handling, as they can be wielded single-handedly, but their true potential is unlocked through dual-handed attacks. These weapons cater to players who enjoy executing spinning slash maneuvers capable of striking multiple targets simultaneously.\n\nAxes\nAxes, being weighty weapons, can be effectively handled with a single hand. These weapons excel in close-quarters combat and offer a diverse array of attacks to choose from.\n\nGreataxes\nGreataxes are formidable weapons capable of inflicting substantial damage and effectively breaking through an opponent's guard. However, their power comes at the cost of slow attack speed, which leaves wielders exposed and vulnerable to counterattacks. To wield Greataxes proficiently, players will need to invest significantly in their Strength stats.\n\nHammers\nHammers possess the ability to deliver mighty, yet slow, attacks that can pack a tremendous punch against enemies and bosses. These weapons are particularly renowned for their effectiveness against heavily armored foes, as well as their capability to shatter shields and break through guards.\n\nFlails\nFlails exhibit an impressive range, allowing wielders to execute forceful single strikes against hostile characters. It's worth noting, however, that they have a slower attack speed. Unlike whips, flails cannot be parried by enemies. Nevertheless, flails possess the unique ability to perform critical attacks, adding a strategic advantage to their usage.\n\nGreat Hammers\nGreat Hammers are specifically crafted for delivering slow, yet devastating, heavy attacks capable of dealing significant damage. These weapons excel when facing heavily armored enemies, allowing users to break through their defenses and dismantle shields. Wielding Great Hammers effectively requires substantial investment in Strength stats to fully harness their power.\n\nColossal Weapons\nColossal Weapons, distinct from Colossal Swords and Hammers, represent a particular category of weapons in Elden Ring. These mighty weapons are characterized by their substantial weight, necessitating wielders to possess high Strength attributes. With their impressive size and heft, Colossal Weapons have the potential to unleash immense damage upon enemies. However, their slow attack speed leaves the wielder vulnerable to counterattacks from adversaries, adding an element of risk to their usage.\n\nSpears\nSpears provide users with the advantage of engaging in melee combat from a safe distance, enabling them to stay out of harm's way. This is especially true for Great Spears, which allow for attacking while keeping a shield raised, enabling users to both block and attack simultaneously. Additionally, spears excel as melee weapons on horseback due to their superior range, making them highly valuable in mounted combat situations.\n\nGreat Spears\nGreat Spears grant players the ability to unleash devastating strikes from considerable distances, albeit at the cost of reduced attack speed and increased weight due to their exceptional heft. Similar to regular spears, Great Spears enable users to maintain a defensive stance by attacking with a shield raised, allowing for simultaneous blocking and attacking. Moreover, these weapons proved to be formidable choices in mounted combat situations, as their extraordinarily long reach sets them apart from other melee weapons, making them well-suited for engagements on horseback.\n\nHalberds\nHalberds achieve a harmonious equilibrium between delivering moderate damage and boasting an extended reach. They accomplish this by combining straight thrusting attacks with wide, sweeping swings.\n\nReapers\nReapers possess an extended reach and feature a distinctive sweeping moveset. These weapons prove especially advantageous when attempting to inflict damage behind shields, provided they are swung with the correct spacing and timing.\n\nWhips\nWhips typically deal modest to moderate damage and are less effective against heavily armored enemies. However, they compensate for this with their notable advantage of a long reach.\n\nFists\nFists are dual-wielded weapons that excel in close-quarters combat. They offer users the ability to execute swift and rapid attacks, capable of swiftly eliminating hostile enemies. Dual-wielding is the way to go however, players also have the ability to single-handedly equip it.\n\nClaws\nClaws, which are worn on both hands, are highly effective in swift, close-quarters combat. These lightweight implements possess inherent Bleed capabilities and are commonly utilized by individuals specializing in Dexterity Builds.\n\nLight Bows\nLight Bows are ranged weapons designed for dealing damage to enemies from a distance. Like other ranged weapons, they do not provide any guard protection. However, Light Bows possess a distinct advantage in that they allow for quick arrow notching and firing immediately after performing a roll or landing from a jump. This feature enables a more aggressive and mobile playstyle, offering versatility in combat. It is important to note that Light Bows require arrows as ammunition to be utilized effectively.\n\nBows\nBows serve as long-range weapons capable of dealing damage to hostile characters from a distance. It's important to note that bows do not provide any guard protection, emphasizing the need for users to keep a safe distance from approaching enemies. In order to utilize bows effectively, arrows are required as ammunition.\n\nGreat Bows\nGreatbows are formidable ranged weapons that excel at dealing damage to hostile characters from a significant distance. One notable advantage of Greatbows is their considerable potential to break through enemy guards. However, it's important to note that Greatbows do not offer any guard protection to the user, further emphasizing the need to maintain distance from advancing enemies. Unlike other types of bows, Greatbows do not possess the ability to fire while mid-jump. To utilize Greatbows effectively, Great Arrows are required as ammunition.\n\nCrossbows\nCrossbows function as ranged weapons capable of inflicting significant damage on hostile characters from a distance. Unlike bows, crossbows need to be loaded before each shot is fired. It's important to note that crossbows do not provide any guard protection to the user, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining a safe distance from advancing enemies. To utilize crossbows effectively, bolts are required as ammunition.\n\nBallistae\nBallistae serve as powerful ranged weapons capable of inflicting substantial damage on hostile characters from a considerable distance. Notably, Ballistae possess significant potential to break through enemy guards. Unlike crossbows, Ballistae do not require loading before firing each shot, providing a more immediate and efficient means of attack. It is important to note that Ballistae, like other ranged weapons, do not provide guard protection to the user, emphasizing the need to maintain distance from advancing enemies. However, Ballistae, in contrast to crossbows, lack the ability to fire while mid-jump. To utilize Ballistae effectively, Great Bolts are required as ammunition.\n\nGlintstone Staves\nGlintstone Staves are essential for casting Sorceries. If you wish to utilize these powerful magic spells, equipping a Glintstone Staff is necessary. Most staves do not possess any additional skills or abilities. Their primary function is to facilitate the casting of Sorceries. As a result, players often rely on a secondary or tertiary weapon for close-quarters combat while using staves primarily for spellcasting purposes.\n\nSacred Seals\nSacred Seals play a crucial role in casting Incantations, which are often associated with the Faith Stat. These seals serve as the means to channel divine powers and perform mystical rituals. It's important to note that Sacred Seals cannot be imbued with new Ashes of War or augmented with armament buffs. They retain their inherent properties without the ability to be further enhanced in this manner.\n\nTorches\nTorches inflict minimal damage, but their primary purpose lies in warding off unwelcome creatures by applying Fire Damage. Additionally, torches serve as a valuable tool for illuminating dark areas, making them essential for exploration in environments with limited visibility.\n\nElden Ring Classes\nIn Elden Ring, classes represent the various combat archetypes that players can choose from during the Character Creation process. Selecting a class has an impact on the player's initial Stats and the Equipment they receive at the beginning of the game. The following information provides an overview of each class, including their attribute point allocation and starting equipment.
