Crystalians are humanoids opponents made of crystals. They are encountered in different locations with varying weapon configurations but the one thing they share is their extremely tough crystal bodies. These are optional bosses as players are not required to defeat them to advance in Elden Ring.\nPutrid Crystalians is a variant of this boss that inflicts Scarlet Rot. Lesser Crystalian is the normal enemy form of this boss. The spirit of a Crystalian can be summoned for aid in battle using the Crystalian Ashes.\n\nThe Crystalians are inorganic beings, yet they live. They cleave close to the ideals of the primeval current, and as such, they are revered guests of the sorcerers..\n\nElden Ring Crystalian Location\nCrystalians are encountered in different locations with varying configurations:\n\nRaya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel (Ringblade) [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nAcademy Crystal Cave (Spear & Staff) [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nAltus Tunnel (Spear & Ringblade) [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nCrystalian Combat information\n\nStance: 70\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nIs vulnerable to a backstab critical\nBefore being stance broken, has an extra 90% negation for all damage types except Strike and has Tier 2 hardness\nOnce its stance has been broken at least once, all attacks will cause it to stagger\nDamage: Standard (Ringblade), Standard, Pierce (Spear), Strike, Magic (Staff)\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Crystalian Boss Guide\n\nCrystalian Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Crystalian:\n\nFocus on getting a stance break on one, after which it will have much lower defense and will stagger easily.\n\nJump attacks and guard counters inflict lots of stance damage, especially with larger weapons. \nUse high poise damage skills such as Ground Slam, Giant Hunt or Lion's Claw.\nRejection,quickly stance breaks Crystalians, in addition it knocks them down even before first stance break\nDragonmaw and Rock Sling are great spells for doing stance damage\nUnblockable Blade from Cipher Pata can break poise with the second hit.\n\nUse Greatshield Soldier Ashes for fights with multiple Crystalians to distract and separate them, given that they're almost impossible to kill.\nUse Night Maiden's Mist, as Crystalians generally move slowly and often stick together in group fights.\n\nMelee Strategy\nCrack ‘em: Your first priority when fighting Crystalians should always be breaking their stance. Once you do so once, killing them becomes much easier: not only will they take more damage, any attack will cause them to stagger, so if you keep attacking they'll never get a hit in edgewise unless you run out of stamina. Focus on guard counters and jumping heavy attacks, as they don't have many good windows for charged heavy attacks. You can also move around Ringblade or Staff variants to get backstabs, and charge a heavy attack as they return to their feet.\nAvoid the Pointy End: The Spear variant is usually the most difficult for melee builds. It has a lot of reach, is hard to backstab, and can cover ground quickly enough to pose a major annoyance in group fights. You can take advantage of its simple brain, though: it will always try to cover ground with Hopping Stab when you're far enough away, and it will do exactly three or five Hopping Stabs before finishing off with either an extra-tall Hopping Stab or a Hopping Swing. Count its attacks, watch for this final one, and get in a jump attack afterwards. Then back far enough away to coax it into another round of Hopping Stabs and repeat the process until you break its stance and can stun-lock it to death.\nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nKeep Your Focus: Going one-on-one with a Crystalian should be easy for a magic user since their ranged attacks are limited and easy to dodge, but group fights will likely pose more of a problem. Breaking their stance is the most important thing, so it's a good idea to choose one and focus all your attacks on it rather than switching between them. Once you break its stance, it should be easy enough to kill it before moving on to your next victim.\n\nCrystalian Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nRingblade Variant\n\nRingblade Swing\nSwings its large ringblade in an arc in front of it\nRoll in the opposite direction of the swing\n\nChakram Swings\nSwings its small chakram in an arc in front of it\nStep or roll back\n\nSeeking Blades\nThrows two small chakrams, one after the other\nRoll forward, block, or run out of the way\n\nRingblade Toss\nRolls its ringblade along the ground so that it returns to the Crystalian\nMove behind it while it waits for the ringblade to return and get a backstab or a charged attack\n\nRingblade Slam\nRaises its ringblade above its head, then slams it down to the ground\nRoll to either side and get in a hit while it recovers\n\nShove\nHolds its ringblade in front of it like a shield, then abruptly shoves it forward.
