Nox Swordstress & Nox Monk are a duo boss comprised of two warriors from the eternal city of Nokstella. They are found in eastern Caelid. These are optional bosses as players are not required to defeat them to advance in Elden Ring, but they provide useful items and Runes upon defeat.\nNox Swordstress and Nox Monk are the normal enemy forms of this boss.\n\nLong ago, the Nox invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.\n\nElden Ring Nox Swordstress & Nox Monk Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Sellia Backstreets\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nBoth Nox Swordstress and Nox Monk must be defeated to win this fight\n\nElden Ring Nox Swordstress & Nox Monk Location\nIn the very northwest of Sellia, Town of Sorcery in eastern Caelid. Their chamber is initially sealed with a barrier which can be dispelled by jumping across rooftops to light a brazier in northwest Sellia. [Map Link]\nFrom the golden tree just south of the Sellia Backstreets Site of Grace [Map Link], face the southern edge of the platform and drop down onto the root below. Follow the root and jump onto the building on your right using the mutated growth as a stepping stone. There should be another ladder here that leads to the brazier that will remove the barrier.\nNox Swordstress & Nox Monk Combat information\n\nHealth: 1,631 HP each\nDefense: 109\nStance: 65\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nThis fight features a Nox Swordstress wielding a Nox Flowing Sword and a Nox Monk wielding a Nox Flowing Hammer\nDamage: Standard, (Swordstress), Standard, Strike (Monk)\nDrops 6,400, Nox Flowing Sword\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 0\nSlash: -10\nStrike: 0\nPierce: 0\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 0\nLightning: 0\nHoly: -20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked.

They'll dodge if you try to use a ranged attack, so use this to your advantage with Kukris or other ranged weapons to try to get them to dodge away from one another. Otherwise, run to a far side of the arena and try to get one to follow you while the other holds back—their slow walking speed will give you some time to fight solo before the other catches up. Try to attack the Monk first, since it's usually more aggressive.\nStagger & Stance: These bosses are lightweight and will stagger easily, but they'll often dodge away after recovering so use heavier weapons to maximize damage. They also have very low Stance, so focus on jump attacks and guard counters to stance break them. Take advantage of your invulnerability during a critical hit to avoid damage from the other boss.\nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nGo Wide: Both bosses will dodge when they see a projectile coming, so using spells like Glintstone Arc from maximum range will help land hits against them.  You can also use Night Sorceries, which they won't see coming and won't be able to dodge.\nSplit Them Up: If both bosses are clustered together, their wide-reaching Flowing Form attacks will make it hard for you to find time to get damage in. Use single-shot spells to get them to dodge apart and move around the arena, taking advantage of their slow walking speed to keep them split up while focusing on whichever boss is closest to you.\n\nNox Swordstress & Nox Monk Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwordstress\n\nSwing\nSwings her sword in various directions\nRoll through this attack and try to end up behind her to get in a hit\n\nFlowing Form\nExtends her sword into a whip and swings it in wide arcs in front of her\nThis has very long range, so try to roll through it rather than backing away\n\nMonk (Hammer Mode)\n\nSwing\nSwings his hammer in various directions\nRoll through this attack and try to end up behind him to get in a hit\n\nLong Swing\nExtends its hammer to medium range and swings it in various directions\nRoll through this attack and try to end up behind him to get in a hit\n\nFlowing Form\nExtends his hammer into a long ball and chain and swings it in wide arcs in front of him\nThis has very long range, so try to roll through it rather than backing away\n\nFist Slam\nRetracts his hammer to his fist, jumps into the air, hovers briefly, then slams his fist into the ground creating a medium shockwave.
