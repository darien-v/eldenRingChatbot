In other words, as long as there is enough FP for the initial cast, thops barrier can be consecutively cast untill stamina runs out.\n\nThops barrier involves taking a long initial wind up to create a non damaging spell burst. Hold casting will cause the character consecutively cast with less windup than the initial cast. \n\nThe initial windup is generally unsuitable for reaction casting even with the maximum casting speed. The consective cast windups also present a less exploitable small opening that seems unaffected by casting speed (needs testing)\n\nWhat can be deflected?\nThops barrier can deflect most projectile based sorceries, incantations and even some weapon skills. Ex: glintstone pebble, triple rings of light, bolt of gransax. Most projectiles will change their flight path to avoid hitting the player, whlie others may knocked back a short distance before continuing to chase the player (ex.rancorcall). Caution must be taken as projectiles are still 'live' even after being deflected and may cause damage after finding an opening or exploding on a nearby object.\n Physical projectiles such as arrows, even those generated by spells (ex. stone of gurranq, rock sling), will not be deflected. Some projectiles will appear as physical but will count as a spell and vise versa (ex. Pest threads will be deflected but morgotts golden throwing knife will not). Mist type spells, all dragon incantations and melee type spells will not be deflected. \nLastly you can deflect your own spells (and possibly ally spells) but these spells will always be sent straight up (needs more testing)\n(List of deflectables coming soon!)\n\nElden Ring Sorceries\n\nAdula's Moonblade  ♦  Ambush Shard  ♦  Briars of Punishment  ♦  Briars of Sin  ♦  Cannon of Haima  ♦  Carian Greatsword  ♦  Carian Phalanx  ♦  Carian Piercer  ♦  Carian Retaliation  ♦  Carian Slicer  ♦  Collapsing Stars  ♦  Comet  ♦  Comet Azur  ♦  Crystal Barrage  ♦  Crystal Burst  ♦  Crystal Release  ♦  Crystal Torrent  ♦  Eternal Darkness  ♦  Explosive Ghostflame  ♦  Fia's Mist  ♦  Founding Rain of Stars  ♦  Freezing Mist  ♦  Frozen Armament  ♦  Gavel of Haima  ♦  Gelmir's Fury  ♦  Glintblade Phalanx  ♦  Glintstone Arc  ♦  Glintstone Cometshard  ♦  Glintstone Icecrag  ♦  Glintstone Pebble  ♦  Glintstone Stars  ♦  Gravity Well  ♦  Great Glintstone Shard  ♦  Great Oracular Bubble  ♦  Greatblade Phalanx  ♦  Loretta's Greatbow  ♦  Loretta's Mastery  ♦  Lucidity  ♦  Magic Downpour  ♦  Magic Glintblade  ♦  Magma Shot  ♦  Meteorite  ♦  Meteorite of Astel  ♦  Night Comet  ♦  Night Maiden's Mist  ♦  Night Shard  ♦  Oracle Bubbles  ♦  Rancorcall  ♦  Ranni's Dark Moon  ♦  Rennala's Full Moon  ♦  Rock Blaster  ♦  Rock Sling  ♦  Roiling Magma  ♦  Rykard's Rancor  ♦  Scholar's Armament  ♦  Scholar's Shield  ♦  Shard Spiral  ♦  Shatter Earth  ♦  Shattering Crystal  ♦  Star Shower  ♦  Starlight  ♦  Stars of Ruin  ♦  Swift Glintstone Shard  ♦  Terra Magica  ♦  Thop's Barrier  ♦  Tibia's Summons  ♦  Unseen Blade  ♦  Unseen Form  ♦  Zamor Ice Storm (Spell)\n\n

QUESTION
Why was Thops's Barrier spell created with a specific focus on deflecting sorceries and incantations rather than physical projectiles or melee attacks?

ANSWER
Thops's Barrier spell was created to deflect sorceries and incantations because it involves a long initial wind-up that makes it unsuitable for reacting to physical projectiles or melee attacks.
