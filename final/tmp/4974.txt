CONTEXT
\nArrows/Bolts in Elden Ring are Ammunition for ranged weapons such as Bows and Crossbows. Beast Bone Arrows/Bolts are available through Crafting while specialty ammunition is purchased from Merchants or found in limited supply. This page covers their names, type, attack power, and passives.\nThe way arrows work is that they add their shown AR values to your bows base AR and are affected by the scaling of your bow. Arrows themselves do not have scaling, but they do utilize the bow's scaling. This means that higher base AR arrows can provide a larger damage boost than the difference might make it seem. This additional base AR also adheres to all the usual scaling rules:\n1. Physical AR on arrows adds to your bows physical AR and is increased by both, your bows strength and dexterity scaling.\n2. Magic AR from arrows is added to any magic base damage and is fixed unless your bow scales with int. The Horn Bow is the only one that scales with intelligence and its scaling does affect the arrows as well.\n3. Fire AR from arrows will scale with your faith if your bow has innate faith scaling. Only the Erdtree Bow has this property, although that's not too valuable because you're splitting your damage between physical/holy/fire which is penalized due to how damage is calculate.\n4. Lightning AR on arrows scales exclusively off your bow's dexterity scaling.\n5. Holy AR scales off faith. Again, this only applies if your bow has innate faith scaling so it's limited to the Erdtree Bow and Erdtree Greatbow.\n6. The status buildup on arrows scales with arcane if your bow has arcane scaling. The Serpent Bow therefore boosts Bleed and Sleep buildup as well.\nFor ranged Builds, it is often easier to farm Runes and purchase Arrows/Bolts directly instead of purchasing Materials to craft them. A list of the Merchants they are sold by can be found below.\n\nAmmunition\n\nBell Bearings\n\nCookbooks\n\nConsumables\n\nCrafting Mats.\n\nCrystal Tears\n\nGreat Runes\n\nInfo Items\n\nKey Items\n\nMultiplayer\n\nRemembrances\n\nTools\n\nUpgrade Mats.\n\nWhetblades\n\nElden Ring Arrows and Bolts\nMerchants with Unlimited Stock\n\nMerchant\nArrows\nBolts\nLocation\n\nMost Merchants\n\nArrow   20\n\nBolt   40\n\nFound throughout the Lands Between\n\nNomadic Merchant Caelid Highway North\n\nFire Arrow   120\n\n-\n\nCaelid, Astray from Caelid Highway North [Map Link]\n\nIsolated Merchant Dragonbarrow\n\nSerpent Arrow   120\n\n-\n\nCaelid, Isolated Merchant's Shack [Map Link]\n\nHermit Merchant\n\nGolden Arrow   120\nGreat Arrow   300\nGolden Great Arrow   500\n\nGolden Bolt   120\nBallista Bolt   300\n\nCapital Outskirts, Hermit Merchant's Shack [Map Link]\n\nFinger Reader Enia\n\nRadahn's Spear   800\n\n-\n\nRoundtable Hold\n\nImprisoned Merchant\n\nDwelling Arrow   160\n\nBurred Bolt   200\n\n Mohgwyn Palace, Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint [Map Link] \n\nIsolated Merchant Raya Lucaria\n\n-\n\nMeteor Bolt   120\n\nLiurnia, Main Academy Gate [Map Link]\n\nNomadic Merchant Caelid South\n\n-\n\nFlaming Bolt   120\n\nCaelid, Southern Aeonia Swamp Bank [Map Link]\n\nNomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau\n\n-\n\nLightning Bolt   160\n\nAltus Plateau, Forest-Spanning Greatbridge [Map Link]\n\nNomadic Merchant Mt.
