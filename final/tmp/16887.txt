CONTEXT
\nWeapons in Elden Ring are pieces of offensive equipment that are used by the player's character to inflict damage against Enemies and Bosses. Elden Ring features 308 Weapons from new categories as well as some returning ones from previous Souls games.  \nPress and hold the interact button (triangle/Y) and the attack button (R1/RB) to two-hand your equipped weapon. \n\nUseful Links\n\nSee Remembrance Weapons for special equipment acquired from Remembrance Items\nSee Upgrades for information on empowering weapons through crafting. Mechanics are slightly different due to Ashes of War.\nSee Shields for a list of available shields.\nSee Armor for a list of all available armor sets.\nSee Skills for a list of all available skills and their effects.\nSee Weapons Comparison Table for a minimalistic view of all Weapons at max upgrade level\nSee Paired Weapons for special movesets associated with dual-wielding.\nSee External Weapon Calculator and All Weapon Stats [src]\nSee Player Trade for information about trading online.\n\nWhat are Remembrance Weapons?\nRemembrance or Boss Weapons, are special weapons used and dropped by Demi-gods and Bosses. These types of Weapons have the ability to hold additional powers and effects, providing extra perks and advantages during combat.\nThey can be obtained by redeeming a Remembrance to Finger Reader Enia and selecting one from the provided options. Each Remembrance provides a fixed set of different options that the player must choose from (The Remembrance will be lost after being redeemed).\nThese weapons are valuable rewards and usually have a superior set of stats compared to regular Weapons. They also have a unique Skill attached to them to complement their already heightened stats.\n\nAll Legendary Weapons in Elden Ring\nTo unlock the Legendary Armaments Trophy and Achievement, you will need to acquire the following weapons:\n\nDevourer's Scepter\nGrafted Blade Greatsword\nSword of Night and Flame\nRuins Greatsword\nMarais Executioner's Sword\nDark Moon Greatsword\nBolt of Gransax\nEclipse Shotel\nGolden Order Greatsword\n\nElden Ring Weapons Types\n\nDaggers\n\nStraight Swords\n\nGreatswords\n\nColossal Swords\n\nThrusting Swords\n\nHeavy Thrusting Swords\n\nCurved Swords\n\nCurved Greatswords\n\nKatanas\n\nTwinblades\n\nAxes\n\nGreataxes\n\nHammers\n\nFlails\n\nGreat Hammers\n\nColossal Weapons\n\nSpears\n\nGreat Spears\n\nHalberds\n\nReapers\n\nWhips\n\nFists\n\nClaws\n\nLight Bows\n\nBows\n\nGreatbows\n\nCrossbows\n\nBallistas\n\nGlintstone Staffs\n\nSacred Seals\n\nTorches\n\nTools\n\nWeapon Requirements & Scaling\nJust like previous From Software titles, all Weapons in Elden Ring have Stat requirements that must be met in order to wield the Weapon effectively. You cannot, for instance, use the Skill of a Weapon if you don't meet its requirements, so plan accordingly, and look for Weapons that you can use effectively.\nScaling is how much damage is added to a Weapon due to your investment in a specific Stat like Strength or Dexterity for example. Elden Ring also handles this in a similar manner to the Souls franchise with "S" being the best Scaling, followed by "A", "B", "C", "D", and "E".\nIn short, the better the letter, the more damage you will deal by investing in the specified scaling Stat. Some Weapons have more than one Scaling Stat, so pay attention to what these are and make sure to increase the ones that give you the most damage per Attribute Point invested.\nYou can change the Scaling on Weapons if you change the Ash of War depending on which Whetblades you have found. For example, if you infuse the Weapon with the Heavy Infution it will remove every Scaling besides STR and upgrade the STR scaling on the weapon.\n\nWeapon Damage Types\nAll Weapons in Elden Ring have one or more Damage Types. For instance, the Longswords do both Standard and Pierce Damage. This is because its normal attacks are considered Standard Damage, while its (R2/RB) attack is a thrust, dealing Piercing Damage. Knowing what Damage Types your chosen Weapon does can benefit you since many enemies are weak or resistant to certain types of damage.\nAdditionally, you can change the Damage Type of many Weapons in Elden Ring by slotting Ashes of War into them from the Ashes of War menu at a Site of Grace. Selecting your Weapon in this menu will show you which Ashes of War you can use on your Weapon from the ones you currently possess.\nFor instance, if you use the Ash of War: Gravitas on your Longsword you will add Magic Damage to the Weapon, on top of the other Damage Types. Slotting this Ashes of War will also change the Scaling of the Longsword from STR D and DEX D into STR D, DEX E, and INT C, allowing you to take better advantage of your Intelligence Attribute. This makes Magic Damage a good type for those using Sorceries, since these get stronger the more Intelligence you possess.\n\nFor more information see the Damage Types page\n\nWeapon Upgrades\nWeapon Upgrades in Elden Ring are done at the Smithing Table. Here you will be able to use Runes and Smithing Stones you've gathered to Upgrade regular Weapons and Somber Smithing Stones to upgrade unique Weapons.\nWhen you Upgrade a Weapon it goes from the base version to the "+1" version of the same Weapon, indicating that it has been Upgraded 1 time. This not only increases the damage of the Weapon, but in some cases, it will also improve the overall Scaling of the Weapon. For instance, when you Upgrade the Longsword to Longsword +1 the Strength Scaling actually improves from D to C, improving the damage you gain from investing in Strength.\nUnlike the Souls games, there are no "Gems" or other materials you use to change the damage type of Weapons. Instead, you use the Ashes of War and Whetblades you find throughout the game. These can be assigned or removed from your Weapon as well, allowing you to try many different versions of your current Weapon, to see what you like best.\n\nSee the Upgrades page for more information about this topic\n\nWeapon Parry Frames\nListed below are some equipment Parry Frame numbers still in preliminary testing. They are listed with the start of the parry frame and the number of parry frames. (Start of Parry Frame/Number of parry frames)\n\nParry + Daggers: 12/9\nParry + Fists: 13/5\nParry + Claws: 13/5\nParry + Curved Swords: 12/5\nParry + Thrusting Swords: 13/5\n\nWeapon Skills & Ashes of War\nMost Weapons in Elden Ring come with a Weapon Skill that can be used by pressing the L2 button. These Skills consume FP when used, which is the blue bar located below your HP bar, and each consumes different amounts based on their relative power. Some Skills can even be "Charged" by holding L2, making them use more FP, but with increased damage or effectiveness.\nMost Weapons in Elden Ring can have their Weapon Skill replaced by slotting an Ashes of War into it. This can be done at a Site of Grace in the Ashes of War menu. This allows you to mix and match Skills with the Weapon you prefer to use, though not all Ashes of War work on all Weapons. Certain Ashes of War are limited to only a specific type of Weapon.\nUsing Ashes of War is not a permanent change, and can be undone at any time by revisiting a Site of Grace and "Un-enhancing" your Weapon. Or you can replace it with other Ashes of War if you like. Keep in mind many Ashes of War also allow you to change the Damage Type of the Weapon or just the Scaling, such as if you select "Keen" or "Quality". However, this is not mandatory and you are free to keep your "Standard" Scaling if you don't want to change this, and you can still use the Weapon Skill anyway.\nNote that not all Weapons allow the use of Ashes of War, such as those that possess unique Weapon Skills like Reduvia.\n\nSee the Ashes of War page for more information\nSee the Skills page for more information\n\nWeapon

ANSWER
Remembrance Weapons are special weapons dropped by Demi-gods and Bosses, providing unique powers that enhance combat, obtained by redeeming a Remembrance to Finger Reader Enia and choosing from fixed options.
