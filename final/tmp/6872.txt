QUESTION
Why are special armaments with unique characteristics unable to be strengthened with colored smithing stones in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Special armaments with unique characteristics cannot be strengthened with colored smithing stones because they require Somber Smithing Stones to reinforce to +4, which differ in the number of steps and amount strengthened compared to standard equipment.
