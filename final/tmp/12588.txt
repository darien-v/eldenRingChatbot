The Carian Knight's Sword scales primarily with Intelligence, Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for dealing Magic Damage from the sorcerous battle skills that it wields. \n\nStraight sword embedded with a blue glintstone. Weapon of knights sworn to Carian royalty.\nThese knights' swords could serve as catalysts, letting them wield sorcerous battle skills. Despite numbering fewer than twenty, this power made them a match for even the champions of gold in battle.\n\nWhere to Find Carian Knight's Sword in Elden Ring\nThe Carian Knight's Sword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nLiurnia of the Lakes: Found in a chest in the back of a Carriage being pulled by two Trolls in the northwest of the lake. [Map Link]\n\nElden Ring Carian Knight's Sword Notes & Tips\n\nThis weapon has a unique heavy attack that can block attacks before its slash comes out. Charging the heavy attack will further extend the time the weapon can block before slashing. Unfortunately, this attack does not work with the Curved Sword talisman. (Only this sword and the Lazuli Glintstone Sword have this move).\nBlocking any attack with this weapon's heavy attack will never put you into stun, unless the move you have blocked completely drains your stamina. \nThis weapon's unique charged heavy attack does significantly less stance damage than other straight swords (1h Charged R2 does 15 stance damage vs. the typical 30 of most straight swords).\nAfter brief testing with the spectral version of the Troll Knight below The Four Belfries, 2-handing this weapon will increase this weapon's guard boost by 10%, just like any other weapon. This does include this weapon's heavy attack and this does stack with the Greatshield Talisman.\nWeapon Skill: Carian Grandeur.\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War.\nCan't be enchanted with Magic nor boosted by Consumables.\nCarian Knight's Sword can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones.\nSell Value:   200 Runes.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, Straight Swords poise damage has been reduced only on PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below. Additionally, the running attack speed, first attack speed and speed of guard counter of straight sword has increased. The attack recovery time has also decreased.\nOther notes and player tips go here\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Carian Knight's Sword\nOne-handed moveset:\n\nLight Attack is a 5-hit combo of diagonal and horizontal strikes ending in a diagonal downwards slash from right to left\nStrong Attack is a diagonal slash from right to left, followed by a slash from left to right on the second input\nCharge Attack is a downward slam, followed by a slash from left to right on the second input.
