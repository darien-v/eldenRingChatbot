CONTEXT
\nStatistics in Elden Ring refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. There are 8 main Stats in Elden Ring, as well as several dozen secondary stats which all contribute to your character's growth and effectiveness in various situations. Stats are affected by a number of things and can be modified by your Level, Equipment, and any active buffs and effects.\nWithin the Status Menu, you can check your level, attributes, base stats, and more. The information shown here also reflects changes to your attack, defense, and resistances bestowed by armaments and armor that you have equipped. \n\nSee Leveling for details on how to level, a breakdown of runes necessary per level, and more.\nSee Runes for details on acquiring runes and rune acquisition boosting equipment.\nSee Rebirth for details on how to reallocate (respec) assigned attribute points.\n\nHow do you increase Stats in Elden Ring?\nThe primary method of increasing your stats is by Leveling Up. Near the beginning of the game and shortly after meeting Melina for the first time, you will unlock the ability to Level Up by spending Runes acquired by defeating enemies.\nElden Ring features 8 Main Stats (also referred to as Attributes). These are your Vigor, Mind, Endurance, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith and Arcane. Each one of these main Stats governs your secondary stats such as HP, FP, Stamina and Equipment Load. Players can spend Runes at a Site of Grace to increase their main stats, effectively increasing their character Level, as well as improving their secondary stats.\nStats are also affected by your current Equipment and any active buffs obtained through Magic or Items. Combining these aspects is key to character progression and creating effective builds in Elden Ring.\n\nCan you respec your Stats in Elden Ring?\nAfter completing Raya Lucaria Academy, you will be able to reset point allocations and redistribute all of your earned Stat points however you wish in exchange for a Larval Tear, a rare item obtained through various means. You would most likely be over level 50 by the point you get to this, so your early build is quite important as you cannot change it: see our Elden Ring Builds page for ideas on how to make a good character.\nThis is commonly known as 'Respeccing' and is a system that caters to players' needs for customization and trying out other builds without having to restart the game over.\nFor more information please visit our Rebirth Page.\n\nElden Ring Stats\n\nLevel\nA cumulative figure that represents overall attribute strength.You can level up using runes.\n\nRunes Held\nTotal runes in possession. Upon dying, you will drop any runes in your possession at the site of your death.\n\nRunes Needed\nNumber of runes required to raise a level.When you Level Up, you can choose an attribute to increase.\n\nMain Character Attributes\nThis section lists all of your character's Main Stats, also referred to as Attributes. These Stats govern all other secondary Stats and can be increased by spending acquired Runes on them using the Level Up menu at any Site of Grace, once the feature is unlocked.\nAt certain points when leveling an Attribute to higher values, you will start getting diminishing returns. i.e. the benefit you gain from leveling that Stat is less significant than before. The values at which these diminishing returns begin are referred to as soft-caps or breakpoints. You can find the soft-cap of each Attribute listed below. Note that some stats actually grant accelerating returns at lower levels: for example, Vigor's HP gain per level increases from levels 1-40, but decreases after level 40.\nThe hard-cap for all Stats is 99: you are unable to level a Stat past that level, and it is not possible to exceed 99 through equipment or buffs. (An exception is that your effective Strength can be increased past 99 by two-handing.)\n\nVigor\nAttribute governing HP.Also affects fire resistance and Immunity stat.\nScaling accelerates until 40.Soft-capped at 40 / 60.\n\nLevel1-40\nHP gain increases from +4 to +48(avg: +29.5)\n\nLevel41-60\nHP gain decreases from +26 to +13(avg: +22.5)\n\nLevel61-99\nHP gain decreases from +6 to +3(avg: +5.1)\n\nMind\nAttribute governing FP.Also affects the Focus stat.\nSoft-capped at 50 / 60.\n\nLevel1-15\nFP gains are between +3 and +4 (LV9: +13)(avg: +3.21)\n\nLevel16-35\nFP gain alternates between +5 and +6(avg: +5.25)\n\nLevel36-50\nFP gains are between +7 and +6(avg: +6.67)\n\nLevel51-60\nFP gains are between +6 and +4(avg: +5.00)\n\nLevel61-99\nFP gain alternates between +2 and +3(avg: +2.56)\n\nEndurance\nAttribute governing Stamina.Also affects Robustness.Determines how heavy your equipment can be, a.k.a. Equip Load.\nSoft-capped for stamina at 15 / 30 / 50.\n\nLevel1-15:\nStamina gains are between +1 and +2(avg: +1.79)\n\nLevel16-30:\nStamina gains are between +1 and +2(avg: +1.67)\n\nLevel31-50:\nStamina gains are between +1 and +2(avg: +1.25)\n\nLevel51-99:\nStamina gains are between +0 and +1(avg: +0.31)\n\nSoft-capped for max equip load at 25 / 60.\n\nLevel9-25:\nMax Equip Load gains alternate between +1.5 and +1.6(avg: +1.59)\n\nLevel26-60:\nMax Equip Load gains are between +1.0 and +1.5(avg: +1.37)\n\nLevel61-99:\nMax Equip Load gains are between +1.0 and +1.1(avg: +1.03)\n\nStrength\nAttribute required to wield heavy armaments.\nInfluences player physical/strike/slash/pierce defense and provides Attack Power scaling for weapons that utilize the stat.\nBreakpoints for AP are: 16, 18, 20, 30, 45, 50, 60, and 80.\nThere is only a minor fall-off in returns after 16, 18, and 20:\n16 for weapons with a quality affinity.18 for weapons with poison, blood, and the physical portion of elemental affinities, and those with no affinity.20 for weapons with heavy, occult, or elemental affinities, and innate elemental scaling.Primary breakpoints are 50, 60, and 80:\n50 for the elemental AP when it benefits from this stat (primarily fire affinity); gains drop substantially beyond this point.60 for the physical AP on all affinities; 56-60 will give lower returns than 60-80.80 for all affinities, but it’s usually only worth getting this much for physical affinities, and even then it can be a stretch.Casting Breakpoints are 30 and 45 (Clawmark Seal and Frenzied Flame Seal both use strength).Each of these values can be divided by 1.5 (rounded up) if you primarily 2h your weapon.\nKeep in mind that the 2h AP bonus does not apply to ashes of war or critical attacks.\n\nDexterity\nAttribute required to wield advanced armaments.
