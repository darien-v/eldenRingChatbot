Crystal Tears can be used and mixed to enhance the effects of the Flask of Wondrous Physick.\n\nA crystal tear formed slowly over the ages where the Erdtree's bounty falls to the ground.\nCan be mixed in the Flask of Wondrous Physick.Causes concoction to explode. \nA defective crystal tear which possesses absolutely no medicinal qualities. A lesson said to be learned the hard way for some; faith can be a volatile matter, after all.\n\nRuptured Crystal Tear Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to Find Ruptured Crystal Tear:\n\nDropped by the Erdtree Avatar that resides in Liurnia of the Lakes. [Map Link]\nDropped by the Putrid Avatar at the Minor Erdtree in the Consecrated Snowfield, east of Ordina, Liturgical Town. [Map Link]\n\nElden Ring Ruptured Crystal Tear Notes & Tips\n\nThere is a delay of 3.2 seconds with an orange pulsing effect around the character before the explosion happens.\n2 Ruptured Crystal Tears can be obtained and stacked. The amount of ruptured tears in the flask affects the potency and radius of the explosion.\nThe explosion deals holy damage, this damage can be raised by items such as the Sacred Scorpion Charm and Incantations such as Golden Vow. \nThe self damage inflicted is flat damage that is not mitigated by damage negation stats.\nYou can use this item to get early access to Leyndell, Royal Capital. Once you acquire this item, head to the teleport chest in Weeping Peninsula, leading you to the Divine Bridge Site of Grace. Head towards the elevator shortcut, start walking towards the ledge, drink the Flask of Wondrous Physick while you're moving so that you start falling down in the exact moment when your character has obtained the buff, then initiate a bare-handed plunging attack when the explosion is about to occur. If done with proper timing, the explosion can cancel the fall damage, allowing you to take the elevator back up and freely access Leyndell. This allows the player to enter the capital without the requirement of obtaining two Great Runes or even accessing Altus Plateau, basically only requiring access to Liurnia. Your Vitality stat doesn't matter in order for the skip to succeed as long as you time the plunge attack correctly (it's confirmed to work on 1.09 with a Rune Level 1 character).\n\nYou can find Crystal Tears at the bases of Minor Erdtrees and elsewhere throughout the Lands Between.\nAt sites of grace, you can mix two crystal tears in the Flask of Wondrous Physick\nThis will allow you to create elixirs with various custom effects.\n\n# of Ruptured Tears in Physick\nRadius of Explosion\nHoly Damage\nFlat Damage to Self\n\n1\n2 meters\n800\n300\n\n2\n4 meters\n1750\n700\n\nElden Ring Crystal Tears\n\nCerulean Crystal Tear  ♦  Cerulean Hidden Tear  ♦  Crimson Bubbletear  ♦  Crimson Crystal Tear  ♦  Crimsonburst Crystal Tear  ♦  Crimsonspill Crystal Tear  ♦  Crimsonwhorl Bubbletear  ♦  Dexterity-knot Crystal Tear  ♦  Faith-knot Crystal Tear  ♦  Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear  ♦  Greenburst Crystal Tear  ♦  Greenspill Crystal Tear  ♦  Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear  ♦  Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear  ♦  Leaden Hardtear  ♦  Lightning-Shrouding Cracked Tear  ♦  Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear  ♦  Opaline Bubbletear  ♦  Opaline Hardtear  ♦  Purifying Crystal Tear  ♦  Speckled Hardtear  ♦  Spiked Cracked Tear  ♦  Stonebarb Cracked Tear  ♦  Strength-knot Crystal Tear  ♦  Thorny Cracked Tear  ♦  Twiggy Cracked Tear  ♦  Windy Crystal Tear  ♦  Winged Crystal Tear\n\n
