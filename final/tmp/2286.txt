CONTEXT
\nDamage Type in Elden Ring is an important mechanic pertaining to Combat. Damage is divided into two major groups: Physical and Elemental. Damage Type is affected by many factors, including your equipment, skills and temporary buffs. Players and enemies can also inflict abnormal status effects which can deal or modify damage.\nThe basic damage calculation is (attack rating - defense) * negation. This calculation applies for each type of an attack's damage. When multiple types of damage are dealt, total damage is the sum of damage from all types. Because defense is subtracted from each damage component, total damage from weapons with two or three damage types is often reduced more than total damage from one type. Many other factors affect damage calculation. Some of these include:\n\nMove Used (Light, Heavy, Critical, etc)\nTarget's Weakpoints\n\nOther useful links:\n\nSee Status Effects for all status buildups and other effects applied to your character.\nSee Buffs & Debuffs for useful information regarding the stacking or overwriting of effects on your character.\nSee Equipment with Special Effects for special stat-increasing or effect-granting weapons and armor.\nSee Affinities for a comparison of each affinity's effects and their respective whetblades. \nSee Special Weaknesses for weapons that deal extra damage to certain enemies.\n\nPhysical Damage types in Elden Ring\n\nStandard Damage\nEffective Against: Most enemies\nIneffective Against:Miners\n\nStrike Damage\nEffective Against: Armored Enemies, Rocky / Brittle Creatures\nIneffective Against: Scaly Creatures\n\nSlash Damage\nEffective Against: Unarmored / Lightly Armored Enemies, Fleshy Creatures\nIneffective Against: Heavily Armored Enemies, Rocky Creatures, Giant Ants\n\nPierce Damage\nEffective Against: Scaly Creatures, Light / Medium Armored Enemies, Players Mid-Attack\nIneffective Against: Heavily Armored Enemies\nNotes:Players are notably weak to Pierce Damage while they making an attack. Catching someone mid-animation will deal significant damage.\n\nElemental Damage types in Elden Ring\n\nMagic Damage\nEffective Against:Armored Enemies, Miners\nIneffective Against:Magic-oriented Enemies\n\nFire Damage\nEffective Against:Unarmored Enemies, Fleshy Creatures, Undead, Wood- and Plant-themed enemies, Giant Ants\nIneffective Against:Heavily Armored Enemies, Draconic Creatures, Fire-Oriented Creatures\nNotes:Fire Damage taken is reduced while wet.Fire Damage cures/resets Frostbite.\n\nLightning Damage\nEffective Against:Heavily Armored Enemies, Abductor Virgins, Silver Tears\nIneffective Against:Ancient Dragons, Tibia Mariners, rock-themed enemies like Golems and Gargoyles, Miranda Sprouts\nNote:Lightning Damage is amplified when the target is wet.\n\nHoly Damage\nEffective Against:Undead, Crabs, Albinaurics\nIneffective Against:Godskin Apostle and Noble, Most Shardbearers, Royal Revenants, Erdtree Avatars, Bell Bearing Hunters, Cleanrot Knights, Omenkillers, Tree Spirits, Crucible Knights, Black Knife Assassins\n\nOther Damage "Types" in Elden Ring\n\nAnimation Critical Damage\nEffective Against:Any enemy that can be backstabbed or placed into a vulnerable state that allows a critical strike (e.g., breaking their poise or guard).This critical damage is defined by the animation the player is locked into when performing their attack.\nIneffective Against:Enemies that cannot be backstabbed or placed in a vulnerable state which allows a critical strike (e.g., Warhawk).\n\nHitbox Critical Damage\nEffective Against:Any enemy with a weak spot. Though often times being the head, some enemies have unique weak spots around their body that will amplify damage dealt.Damage dealt to these areas will often deal a greater amount of poise damage as well.\nIneffective Against:Enemies that lack a weak spot (e.g., Skeletal Slimes).\n\nCategorical Special Bonuses\nEffective Against:Some enemies belong in categories (Undead, Gravity, (Ancient) Dragons), which may receive extra damage from certain Weapons and Spells. See Special Weaknesses for details.\nNotes:This is not a separate type of damage, just a damage increase by some weapons on certain enemies.\n\n Additional Notes about Damage Types in Elden Ring\n\nAll attacks are comprised of one or more of the original eight damage types (Standard, Strike, Slash, Pierce, Magic, Fire, Lightning, Holy).\nBuffs and debuffs to damage negation and attack rating stack multiplicatively.\nThe Heavy Affinity adds Strength scaling to a weapon, which benefits from two-handing a weapon (50% more damage).\nThe Keen Affinity adds Dexterity scaling to a weapon, which benefits from wielding a weapon one-handed.\nThe Quality Affinity adds Strength and Dexterity scaling to a weapon, but to a lesser degree than Heavy or Keen alone (two-handing is less effective than Heavy but more so than Keen as well).\nThe Magic Affinity adds Magic attack to a weapon, which scales on Intelligence.\nThe Cold Affinity adds Magic attack and Frost build-up to a weapon, which scales slightly on Intelligence.\nThe Fire Affinity adds Fire attack to a weapon, which scales on Strength.\nThe Flame Art Affinity adds Fire Attack to a weapon, which scales on Faith.\nThe Lightning Affinity adds Lightning Attack to a weapon, which scales on Dexterity.\nThe Sacred Affinity adds Holy Attack to a weapon, which scales on Faith.\nThe Poison Affinity adds Poison status buildup to a weapon, which scales slightly on Arcane.\nThe Blood Affinity adds Bleed status buildup on a weapon, which scales slightly on Arcane.\nThe Occult Affinity does not change damage types, but scales the weapon on Arcane, and improves innate Bleed/Poison.\nMany consumable items, spells, and weapon skills buff a weapon and add damage types to them.\nThe toxic spray attack of Giant Ants is a Standard-type attack that subtracts 60% physical damage absorption from the player's shield.\nAll attacks deal some amount of Poise, but this does not subtract from the HP pool of the target and is therefore not counted as a Damage Type.\n\n
