These catlike hounds guard catacombs throughout the Lands Between, wielding swords and staves as well as elemental magic. These are optional bosses, meaning players don't need to defeat them in order to advance.\nThe Lesser Burial Watchdog is the normal enemy form of this boss. \n\n The Watchdogs, battered and broken over their lengthy tenure, rule the catacombs and are even said to command the imps.\n\nWhere to find Erdtree Burial Watchdog in Elden Ring\nErdtree Burial Watchdog can be found in:\n\nStormfoot Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nImpaler's Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nCliffbottom Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nMinor Erdtree Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\nWyndham Catacombs [More Info] [Map Link]\n\nErdtree Burial Watchdog Combat information\n\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being stance broken or parried\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 35\nSlash: 35\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: Immune\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nErdtree Burial Watchdog Boss Guide for Elden Ring\n\nErdtree Burial Watchdog Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Erdtree Burial Watchdog:\n\nKaiden Sellsword Ashes make early Watchdog fights a breeze.\nIf you hit a Watchdog with several Crystal Darts, it will go berserk and attack the closest thing, whether it be friend or foe. This can force it to focus on your summons while you attack it at range, but its most useful for forcing the Watchdog in Impaler's Catacombs to fight its Imps or the Watchdogs in Minor Erdtree Catacombs to fight one another.\n\nMelee Strategy\nFor melee users, the best way to win this fight is to bait its attacks. Try dodge rolling to its side after a strike, get a few hits in, then dodge away. Some of its attacks covers a wide range, so having a good shield is also handy, but avoid guarding against the Levitating attacks since they can hit over a shield. If you end up behind the Watchdog, beware of its Tail Slam attack that can still hit you.\nJump Attacks: Jumping is effective for dodging both the Levitating and Spinning Swipe attacks. Jump to dodge and then do a jumping attack to build up Stance damage and get in critical hits.\nParries: Since their attacks are well-telegraphed, they can be parried with relative ease.\nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nThis fight is considerably easier for ranged and magic users since all you need to do is keep your distance. You may have to roll or jump away several times during the Levitating attacks, since it likes to do this many times in a row, but eventually it will stop and switch to more easily punishable attacks.\nGlintstone Pebble and Lightning Spear are excellent spells for these fights. Spells that can stun them such as Rock Sling can also help.\n\nAttacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwing\nSwings its weapon in various orientations\nBlock the attack or roll through the swing\n\nThrust\nLeans back and immediately thrusts its sword forward.\nThis move does not cover a lot of distance so you can easily back away. If you're close, rolling to either side and get a few attacks in\n\nTail Slam\nTurns its head to face its back, then slams its tail into the ground. Usually does this when you're behind it. Only Watchdogs with lit tails will do this. \nDodge roll away as soon as you see its head turn around.\n\nOverhead Swing\nStands up and walks forward, pauses for a moment, then slams its weapon on the ground.\nRoll to the side as it pauses before the slam and get in a few hits while it's recovering\n\nBreath Attack\nFire: The Watchdog’s head begins to shake, before it exhales an stream of flames from its mouth while chasing its targetLightning: The Watchdog rears its head back before launching a large ball of lightning.\nCircle around behind, then land a few hits before backing away. Careful not to get too greedy, as it can quickly turn around. If you're far away when it fires lightning, hide behind a pillar.\n\nWeaponSlam\nHolds its weapon horizontally and slams it down on the ground\nBlock the attack or roll as the weapon reaches its peak\n\nLevitatingSlam\nRises into the air, then slams its weapon into the ground, producing a small shockwave. The staff variant will produce a wider magical shockwave\nJump left or right over the shockwave and do a jump attack, but be careful not to get hit by the sword or the Watchdog's body. You can also roll, but the timing is less forgiving.\n\nSword Variant\n\nSpinning Swipe\nPuts its sword on the ground to its right, then spins quickly in a 540° circle\nJump over the sword or roll in the opposite direction the sword is moving. This is only parriable when the sword has rotated 450°\n\nStaff Variant\n\nSorcery of the Crozier\nSummons a circle of magical projectiles that fly towards the player.\nRun to the sides or dodge forward through the projectiles.\n\n: Attack can be parried\nElden Ring Erdtree Burial Watchdog Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nFormerly called Burial Tree Watchdogs in the Closed Network Test.\nFrost Watchdogs are only seen as regular enemies, while the Lightning variant is only seen as a boss.\n\nErdtree Burial Watchdog Combo Chart\n\n Erdtree Burial Watchdog Stormfoot CATACOMBS
