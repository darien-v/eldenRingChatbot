CONTEXT
\n\n Mohg's Great Rune \n\nType\nGreat Rune\n\nEffect \n\n        Grants a blessing of blood to phantoms \n\nMohg's Great Rune is a Great Rune and Multiplayer Item in Elden Ring. Great Runes in Elden Ring are special items dropped by Demigod Bosses that can be equipped to acquire special passive bonuses.\n\nA Great Rune of the shardbearer Mohg.Its blessing grants a blessing of blood to summoned phantoms, and imparts a Phantom Great Rune upon successful invasion.\nMohg and Morgott are twin brothers, and their Great Runes are naturally similar.\nBut Mohg's rune is soaked in accursed blood, from his devout love for the wretched mire that he was born into far below the earth.\n\nWhere to find Mohg's Great Rune in Elden Ring\n\nDropped as a reward for defeating Mohg, Lord of Blood at the Mohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum. [Map Link]\nVideo Location\n\nElden Ring Mohg's Great Rune Use\nMohg's Great Rune allows the user to grant the Blessing of Blood to summoned spirits (from Spirit Ashes or Legendary Spirit Ashes) or the native monsters/bosses in an invaded world.\nThe Blessing of Blood makes it so every time those blessed by it kill an enemy, the user of the Great Rune will be healed by 10% of their maximum HP. Additionally, when any one is overcome and inflicted with blood-loss within the vicinity of a blessed individual, the blessed individual(s) will gain a damage buff similar to that of Lord of Blood's Exultation for approximately 20 seconds.\nWhen invading with the rune's effect active, the invader gets 3 phantom great runes: which allow the user to apply the blessing to monsters who are within melee range. The first use of the phantom great runes costs health, while subsequent uses have no cost other than the item itself.For a more detailed explanation of the effects of this rune, see below.\nIf you want to use Mohg's Great Rune after acquiring it from Mohg, Lord of Blood, you will need to restore its power (similarly to other Great Runes) by visiting the appropriate Divine Tower; in this case, the Divine Tower of East Altus. \nTo reach the location, follow the Capital Outskirts ramparts to the lift that leads to Forbidden Lands, but instead of descending through the lift, go south-east and towards the other doorway which will lead you directly to the Divine Tower. If you already reached the Forbidden Lands' starting Site of Grace, you can also teleport to it and backtrack through the lift. Be wary that you will be required to defeat the Fell Twins boss as you cross the bridge in order to progress to the tower itself.\nOnce unlocked, the Divine Tower of East Altus Gate site of grace is in the menu under the Mountaintops of the Giants section in the Forbidden Lands sub-menu.\n\nMohg's Great Rune Usage and Effect Details\nAll functionality of the Great Rune is not enabled if a Rune Arc is not used (even though when invading or being summoned, other Great Runes' effects are disabled, this is the only one whose effect stays active and requires a Rune Arc to be used BEFORE the invasion takes place for it to activate).\n The effects of this Great Rune are detailed below:\n\nWhen in your world, Summoned Spirits (from Spirit Ashes items) automatically gain the buff called Blessing of Blood.\nThe Blessing of Blood has the following effects: \n\nDuration: The duration of the Blessing of Blood itself is INFINITE.\nVisually: A subtle red smoke aura envelops those affected. This is the indication that Blessing of Blood effect is active.\nHealing On Kill: Each time a blessed mob ally kills an enemy within close proximity of the blessing's owner, the owner is healed by 10% of their maximum HP. This effect stacks with other ''life-steal'' effects and looks the same as them, like the talisman Taker's Cameo.\nDamage Buff on Blood-loss Infliction: Whenever blood-loss is inflicted nearby (7 meters) a blessed ally, that ally gains a damage buff of 30% and heals 5% + 60 HP. \n\nWhen triggered again, resets the buff timer. \nBlood-loss status effect is "inflicted" when the blood-loss status meter is filled, triggering the effects of said status and any other effects pertaining to it.\nStacks with the talisman Lord of Blood's Exultation (should the Spirit be the Mimic Tear Ashes with that talisman equipped).\nVisually, this effect looks like red vertical lines appearing around the player's body.\n\nIt DOES NOT apply the blessing to the player nor any other players. Only spirits summoned by the player in their world or monsters and bosses native to the invaded world when invading gain the Blessing of Blood. This makes the Great Rune useless in single-player if the player is not summoning spirits, and useless when the player is invading if no monsters or bosses to bless are present.\nThe following additional effects apply when a player is invading another player's world, with the Great Rune active (meaning the player used a Rune Arc): \n\nAs the player arrives to the invaded world, the player receives 3 copies of a temporary unique consumable item, called Phantom Great Rune. When consumed, the player plays the same animation as consuming a Rune Arc, generating a small red area-of-effect which buffs any monsters or bosses (like Night's Cavalry) in close proximity to the player with the Blessing of Blood. For the exact effects of the Blessing of Blood, see above. When invading, this is the only way to apply the Blessing of Blood to the monsters and bosses.\nIf the player does not use the Phantom Great Rune during their invasion, the effect of Mohg's Great Rune is essentially wasted, as the Phantom Great Runes disappear from the Player's inventory when returning to their world. The Great Rune effect still persists after a failed invasion, so subsequent invasions will still grant the Phantom Great Runes until the player dies in their own world.\n\nElden Ring Mohg's Great Rune Notes & Tips\n\nSince the effect only applies to allied Non-Player-Characters (summoned as Host, or native to the world as Invader), if none are present, the effect of the rune is wasted.\nIf the player himself wishes to have effects similar to the ones granted by the Blessing of Blood, the talisman Lord of Blood's Exultation gives the same damage boost every time blood-loss is applied in the vicinity and the talisman Taker's Cameo heals when enemies are defeated in the vicinity. If the player were to summon a Mimic Tear  spirit (which copies the current equipment of the player who summoned it), those effects would stack with the Blessing of Blood effects powering the Mimic Tear even more.\nSince the duration of the Blessing of Blood buff is infinite, when the player is invading another player's world it's a good idea to buff monsters/bosses the player expects the invaded players to encounter either to set up ambushes or weaken the invaded player. Confirmation is required of whether or not blessed monsters retain their blessing even if the invader (the user of the Phantom Great Rune) dies and leaves the world.\nIn short, the afore-mentioned effects leads to a few possible uses for this Great Rune: \n\nIf the player is the Host, it is useful to increase the damage of summoned spirits, assuming either the spirit or the Host has the means of applying blood-loss. But even if no blood-loss is present, it can be very useful for giving summons the ability of healing the Host for every enemy they kill, aiding the survivability of the Host. This is a strong buff given the player has the chance to defeat many monsters in-between bosses, and most of the time Spirits are available for summon is to fight big groups of enemies. If the fight were to be against only a boss though, the healing effect would be far less useful (since once the boss dies the fight is over and a 10% HP heal becomes irrelevant).\nIf the player is Invading another player's world, it is useful only to boost the damage of monsters and bosses if blood-loss is triggered in their vicinity. The main problem with this is players move a lot and it is not rare for a blood-loss to trigger when the enemies are too far to benefit from it; specially since NPCs are not good at inflicting blood-loss to experienced players. Either way, the life-steal effect does apply to the monsters too, but since the monsters are only hostile to the rival player, they'd have to sucessfully defeat a player which, again, is a hard feat to pull off for a monster, specially since the monster has to be the one that lands the killing blow for the heal effect to activate. As such, and maybe ironically, it seems this rune is far more useful for when the player is the Host, rather than invading.\n\nElden Ring Great Runes\n\nGodrick's Great Rune  ♦  Great Rune of the Unborn  ♦  Malenia's Great Rune  ♦  Mending Rune of Perfect Order  ♦  Mending Rune of the Death-Prince  ♦  Mending Rune of the Fell Curse  ♦  Morgott's Great Rune  ♦  Phantom Great Rune  ♦  Radahn's Great Rune  ♦  Rykard's Great Rune\n\n
