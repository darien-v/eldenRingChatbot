This is not an optional boss as players must defeat this foe in order to advance in Elden Ring.\n\n The Fire Giant is a survivor of the War against the Giants. Upon realizing the flames of their forge would never die, Queen Marika marked him with a curse.\n\n"O trifling giant, mayest thou tend thy flame for eternity."\n\nElden Ring Fire Giant Boss\n\nThis is not an optional boss as it must be defeated to unlock Crumbling Farum Azula and continue the story.\nClosest Site of Grace: Foot of the Forge\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: Iron Fist Alexander can be summoned to help within the boss arena. His summon sign is a short distance into the upper-elevation yellow fog gate.  Use the southerly chain bridge entrance closest to the Foot of the Forge site of grace, not the other fog gate.  Unlike other summons, Alexander’s summon sign is beyond the fog gate, not outside of it.\n\nElden Ring Fire Giant Location\nFrom the Foot of the Forge Site of Grace, head across the chasm on one of the chains to enter the boss arena. [Map Link]\nFire Giant Combat information\n\nHealth: 42,363 HP \nDefense: 118\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken in Phase 2 only\nWeak spot (Phase 1): wounded leg (+100% damage)\nWeak spot (Phase 2): wrists and eye (+100% damage)\nDamage: Standard, Strike, Fire\nDrops 180,000, Remembrance of the Fire Giant\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 0\nSlash: -10\nStrike: 0\nPierce: 0\n\nMagic: 0\nFire: 50\nLightning: 0\nHoly: 20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked.

Avoid low health group summons like the wolves, as he can cleave them down with ease\nAlternatively, summon Alexander as his attacks are very powerful in terms of breaking Giant's poise.\nUse the Rotten Breath/Ekzykes's Decay Incantation\nBring ?? Item\nFire giant is resistant to bleed but not immune, making weapons that inflict bleed effective - especially with Giant large healthbar. Antspur Rapier with Ash of War: Seppuku and imbued with poison will inflict poison, Scarlet Rot, and bleed, enhanced further with items such as Mushroom Crown, Lord of Blood's Exultation, and Kindred of Rot's Exultation.\nDuring the second phase, the incantation Swarm of Flies can be used to inflict bleed during openings when the boss halts, which can be enhanced with items such as Radagon Icon, Faithful's Canvas Talisman, and Lord of Blood's Exultation.\n\nMelee Users\nUse Torrent to close the initial distance, using the dismount to i-frame through the giants first attack. Do not stay on Torrent in the first phase; the fire giant will constantly use swipe and jump attacks that require using I-frames to dodge, which is not possible using torrent. You can use him to safely close the distance again if needed, dismount i-framing through his attacks.\nPhase 1\nDuring this phase, the giant is somewhat mobile, and will roll to build distance if you get behind or below him for too long. Aim for his left leg, which is wrapped in its own hair. Once this breaks, it reveals a weak spot. He will pause for a moment when it does, so take the opportunity to get in some free damage.\nOnce broken, he will always roll away. He now gains 2 new attacks:\n\nA slow moving orb, which explodes once it gets close, or after a period of time. Bait the explosion, and roll away quickly from the area, as it leaves behind a field of fire. You can use Torrent to make this easier, but be wary of doing this within range of his lid swings\nThe second is a simple fireball projectile launched from his hand, which is only a concern if he rolls too far away. Simply watch out for it and dodge. Its hitbox is deceptively larger than it appears.\n\nOnce the Fire Giant reaches around half health, a cutscene ensues in which his ankle breaks from the Tarnished's attacks, causing great pain to the Fire Giant. He rips the foot off his broken leg and uses it as a sacrifice to awaken a mysterious power inside him, beginning the next phase.\nPhase 2\nFor the second phase of the boss, his weakspot moves to his left forearm. However, this is a very dangerous place to be so hop on torrent and stick to his backside, as most of his attacks are to the front. Be wary of the sides as he will roll to reposition.The boss can be staggered, allowing you to stab his eye for massive damage. Be cautious with this however, as he doesn't stay down for long, and being in front leaves you vulnerable.There are new additions to be concerned about here, as well as add-ons to previous attacks:\n\nThe slow tracking fire orb now spawns in pairs. Provoke the explosions and run away.\nThe fireball spell will now be launched twice. Get on Torrent and strafe to avoid.\nGains a new Fire Pillar attack; run far away as this attack will spawn heavily-damaging fire pillars underneath him.\nWill, and launch volcanic rocks into the air. Stay on Torrent, and build distance whilst dodging.\n\nThis boss has a lot of hp, so be patient and keep an eye on your stamina and Torrent's health. Stock up on Frozen Raisins if necessary.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nThe tactics for ranged users are essentially the same as melee. It's recommended to stay close to the fire giant as this eliminates the launched fireball attack from consideration.\nWhen you take on the Fire Giant as a sorcerer, it is best to have a particularly quick-casting, hard-hitting spell on hand (such as Stars of Ruin). You're not going to have to worry about burning through all of your FP, because like fighting a troll or the giant stone sentinels, the Fire Giant is extremely vulnerable to attacks on his weak points and we're particularly good at hitting them. Thanks to this, he can, and will, fold like a wet noodle with a little work. Some things that are extremely important to take into consideration:\n\nAs with melee users, it is best to avoid using Torrent. Fire Giant deals an insanely high amount of damage with all attacks, and us sorcerers typically will not survive being hit by him. Fortunately, he is easy to dodge and his attacks are highly telegraphed.\nIf you have Black Knife Tiche at +6 or higher, she is definitely recommended. During phase one, Fire Giant is very mobile and has a tendency to roll away from you so you will have to close the distance. Tiche is extremely aggressive and very fast, but also good at dodging. She will almost always pull aggro when the giant rolls away from you which will allow you time to reposition and start hitting him with your spells again.\nIf you can stay under or even behind him in phase one this can be very useful. If you cannot, stay at least far enough back that you can always see his weird disk as that will be the best hint as to what attack he is using next. \nWhen phase two begins you'll be sitting a lot better than you were in phase one. It might take a try or two to get used to what he has going on, but once you do you can take advantage of his new move set. For one, he becomes almost entirely stationary, and switches to a lot of ranged attacks. Some may suggest staying close to avoid his fireball, but keeping a little distance to bait out his fireball is not a bad idea as it is extremely easy to dodge. \n\nHe may also use his big fire pillar AoE attack which is basically free real estate for us as we can hit him with impunity while he uses it.\n\nThe biggest threats from him are his ice wave attack as the animation can be easily confused for one of his sweep attacks, and the slow moving fireball he uses. It will follow you around for quite a while and just serves to be a nuisance. \n\nThe Fire Giant can be quite intimidating. He's been getting a bad rep as extremely dangerous and very difficult. Go into it expecting to lose 5-10 times, and unless you get really lucky right away take the time to learn his attacks and then just dodge him and laugh at him as he struggles to deal with you and your glorious sorceries. He's far easier than he looks at first so don't fall to the hype!\nFor Incantation users, a lot of the advice is similar, but additionally Rotten Breath is very effective, and Pest Threads (at close range) deals heavy damage to large targets like the giant.\n\nFire Giant Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nAvalanche\nThe giant places the lid directly in the ground and launches a fast moving wave of snow towards the player.\nDodge as the snow gets close, or get behind him before it launches. If used when approaching on horse, use dismount I-frames to avoid the attack.\n\nJumpingSmash\nThe giant jumps in the air, and slams the large lid on the ground\nDodge as the lid lands, using i-frames to avoid damage\n\nLid Swing\nThe giant swings the lid at the player. He may do a follow up swing\nDodge through the lid. Aim for his feet once he's done attacking.\n\nStomp\nThe giant stomps his foot, dealing high damage and stun.\nDodge as the foot lands\n\nRoll\nThe giant quickly rolls forward to reposition itself.\nBehind the giant is safe, otherwise, dodge through it.\n\nGiantsflame, Take Thee\nThe giant launches a fast moving fire projectile at the player. This is only used when the brace on his damaged foot is broken. In phase 2, he will launch two at once.\nDodge as soon as the projectile leaves his hand. Torrent can easily dodge this by moving to the sides.\n\nFlame of the Fell God\nOnly used when the foot brace is broken. The giant summons a slow moving orb that tracks the player. Once it gets in range, it explodes for massive damage, and leaves a field of fire. He spawns them in pairs in phase 2\nBait the explosion if possible, and roll quickly away to avoid the lingering field of fire. These orbs are persistent and will take a long while to explode if not provoked.\n\nBurn, O Flame!\nThe giant lets out a roar and ignites his hands, slamming them into the ground and spawning several fire pillars in the vicinity.\nRun away, or tuck in close and watch for the patches of fire to appear.\n\nFlame, Fall Upon Them\nThe giant’s mouth releases a mighty roar, spewing out explosive rocks into the air which fall onto the ground. They linger for a while before exploding.\nTake this opportunity to get behind it and do some damage.\n\nFire Breath\nThe Fell God's mouth releases a large stream of fire in front of it, tracking the player’s movement.\nRun away while on horseback or get behind it and attack. \n\nSwipe\nThe giant swipes from either left or right with his hand at anyone in front of him\nStay behind the giant, or roll through his hand\n\nFire Giant Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Shaun Dooley\nFire Giant's phase transition happens when it reaches 47% health.\nAlexander's summon for this fight is unique, as his sign is inside boss fight arena. \nDuring first phase, there is an additional model of Fire Giant. This model is swapped with the first one during phase transition (sometimes at the beginning of 2nd phase player can hear the sound similar to one, which can be heard during Giant death). \nDuring 1st phase, boss is immune to debuff caused by Blade of Death and Destined Death - skills saps his HP, but does not reduce his max HP. This is a very rare immunity in Elden Ring and it is unknown, whenever it is either a glitch or there is a lore explanation.\nAt one point during Elden Ring’s post-launch, there was a bug related to Status Effects. If the player manage to get to 2nd phase via Poison, Scarlet Rot, Hemorrhage or Frostbite, it's effect would be multiplied in 2nd phase. What could even "skip" the 2nd phase. \nThe Trolls are said to have been descendants of the Giants, and have since betrayed them during the war. Some have speculated that the gaping holes in the Troll’s midsection may have been where the Fell God resided, and have since been excised when they switched sides.\n\nDialogue\nDuring Fight:\nPhase 2 transition cutscene:\nAaargh!
