These giant decayed imitations of dragons dwell underneath the earth. This Elden Ring Dragonkin Soldier Guide features boss locations, tips, strategies and videos on how to defeat the Dragonkin Soldier easily, as well as boss stats and lore for the Dragonkin Soldier. Bosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Great Enemy bosses can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items. This is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, doing so yields useful items, as well as Runes.\nSee also Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella and Lesser Dragonkin Soldier (Spirit).\n\n Alas, the Dragonkin Soldiers never attained immortality, and perished as decrepit, pale imitations of their skyborn kin.\n\nWhere to Find Dragonkin Soldier In Elden Ring\n\nSiofra River [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nLake of Rot [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nDragonkin Soldier Combat information\n\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\nWeak spot: head (+20% damage)\nDamage: Standard\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 0\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Dragonkin Soldier Boss Guide\n\nDragonkin Soldier Boss Video Guide\n\nDragonkin Soldier Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Dragonkin Soldier:\n\nAt the start of the fight, the boss is slow to get up, which can allow one to get multiple hard hits in. This can take away a third to half of its HP right off the bat\nUse Spirit Jellyfish Ashes to distract the boss, since it has a lot of health. If you have obtained Latenna's Spirit Ash, you can place her out of range which allows her to steadily damage the boss from afar.\nNight Maiden's Mist is a good way to get in some extra damage, since the Dragonkin Soldier is large and will tend to stay in contact with the cloud for a long time. \n\nMelee Strategies\nAnkle Biter: Stay near its legs as much as possible, where few of its attacks will damage you. Take care to avoid running or dodging forward towards its the stomach, since melee weapons without a particularly long reach tend to get blocked by its large belt. Instead, move forward and to the left or right to reach the Soldier's elbows or knees. Even when it turns around, you'll usually have enough time to run around its side and continue attacking. The main attacks to watch out for are Two-Hand Slam and Deep Slam, which create large enough shockwaves to hit you even at its feet. When it starts raising its hands for one of these, back off and jump attack in as it finishes.\n\nMagic and Ranged Strategy\nCircle and Strafe: Dragonkin Soldier's movements are quite slow, so if you keep a medium distance it should be fairly easy to tell when it's safe to start attacking and when you should prepare to dodge. Circle clockwise to give yourself a bit of a head start against its longest-ranged attacks, and be prepared to start running if it roars to begin its Charge attack. Consider using Barricade Shield to block any heavy attacks that you don't have time to dodge.\n\nDragonkin Soldier Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nArm Swing\nSwings one of its arms along the ground in front of it\nDodge forward and stay by its legs to avoid most of these attacks\n\nDragging Claw\nBrings its right arm up in a claw to its left, then drags it clockwise along the ground\nRun forward or back when you see it form the claw, or roll when it starts pulling it back if you don't notice in time\n\nLunging Claw\nCrawls forward one step with its right hand, then lunges forward and stretches its left arm far in front of its body, slamming it down with a shockwave\nRoll to either side when you see its left arm begin to fall\n\nPalm Slam\nRaises its left hand high into the air, then slams it down in front creating a shockwave\nRun underneath the Soldier and get some hits in while it winds up and recovers\n\nElbow Drop\nLifts its right elbow and then slams it to the ground, creating a shockwave around its hand\nRoll forward or back when the elbow reaches the peak of its arc\n\nGround Rip\nShoves its left hand straight down beside it creating a shockwave, then rips up the earth as it draws its hand forward and collapses, arm outstretched\nIf you're near the hand when this starts, dodge towards its legs. Otherwise, dodge left or right just after its hand hits the ground\n\nTwo-Hand Slam\nRaises both its hands, then slams them down, creating a large shockwave. Usually used when you're beneath it\nMove back when you see it raise its hands, then get in a jump attack when you see its elbows start to fall\n\nBody Slam\nStands up on its hind legs, creating a small shockwave with each footfall, then collapses forward creating a large shockwave as its body hits the ground\nStart running away when you see it start to stand up, then dodge or jump as its knees hit the ground\n\nDeep Slam\nRises to its feet while raising one of its hands high in the air, then drives it deep into the ground, creating a large shockwave. Pulls it out a little over two seconds later, creating another large shockwave\nTo play it safe, run away when you see it rise onto its feet and only come back once its arm is out of the ground. If you're willing to take some risk, dodge or jump both shockwaves and land some hits in between\n\nCharge\nLets loose a roar which will stagger you if you're close, slams down its right hand with a small shockwave, lunges forward with its left forearm, then swings its right arm in a wide arc before turning to face the player. Used at most once per minute\nGet behind it after it roars. If you're too far away, try to run around it in a wide circle as it moves\n\nDragonkin Soldier Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nAccording to their item drops, they were born in the Eternal Cities, but unfortunately, they never attained immortality like the stone-scaled dragons of the surface and soon perished as mere imitations. The ones you meet are most likely reanimated corpses, as they are covered in wraps and their bodies have little to no flesh within.\n\nDragonkin Soldier Combo Chart\n\n Dragonkin Soldier  Siofra River  \n\nDrops\n16,000Dragon Halberd\n\nHP\n5,758\n\nElden Ring Dragonkin Soldier Boss (Siofra River)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Worshippers' Woods\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nDragonkin Soldier Location\nHead south from the Worshippers' Woods Site of Grace to a collapsed pillar with an Ancestral Follower archer perched on it.

Get too close, and it will slam the ground and cause shockwaves. But if you keep a medium distance, you can force it into a pattern where it uses close to mid range attacks which can easily be avoided on horseback by charging the boss and staying to your right. Even its left-hand arm swing will go over your head. You can get in several hits while the boss recovers from its attacks, and then dash back to medium range, rinse, and repeat.\n\n Dragonkin Soldier  Lake of Rot  \n\n__image__\n\nDrops\n58,000Dragonscale Blade\n\nHP\n7,655\n\nElden Ring Dragonkin Soldier Boss (Lake of Rot)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Lake of Rot Shoreside\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nDragonkin Soldier Location\nHead south-southeast from the Lake of Rot Shoreside until you see the Dragonkin Soldier slumped over in the rot.
