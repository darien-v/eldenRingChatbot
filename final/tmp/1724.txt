These skeletal bird-like creatures are found throughout the lands between, usually at night. These are optional bosses as players are not required to defeat them in order to advance in Elden Ring, but they do provide useful items and Runes upon defeat. Unlike their weaker cousins the Deathbirds, they have a full set of wings and wield powerful ghostflame magic.\n\n In the time when there was no Erdtree, death was burned in ghostflame. Deathbirds were the keepers of that fire.\n\nWhere to find Death Rite Bird in Elden Ring\nDeath Rite Birds can be found in:\n\nAcademy Gate Town [More Info] [Map Link]\nCaelid [More Info] [Map Link]\nMountaintops of the Giants [More Info] [Map Link]\nApostate Derelict [More Info] [Map Link]\n\nDeath Rite Bird Combat information\n\nStance: 120\nParryable: No\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\n Undead type\nDamage: Standard, Pierce, Magic\nInflicts: Frostbite, Death Blight\nWeak spot: head\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: -40\nPierce: 35\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 40\nHoly: -40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Death Rite Bird Boss Guide\n\n Death Rite Bird Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Death Rite Bird:\n\nHoly Water Pots can take advantage of its weakness to Holy damage and the pots' inherent 400% damage bonus against  Undead enemies to do massive damage even at low Faith\nThe Sacred Blade skill is another great way for non-Faith builds to do Holy damage\nUse Fallingstar Beast Jaw's skill, Gravity Bolt, when locked onto the Death Rite Bird's head to quickly break its stance\nBlind spots include right under the Death Rite Bird or behind it, but ghostflame can limit even these locations\nBe careful when locking onto its head, as it moves around quickly and can easily disorient you. It's a good idea to only lock onto its head when you're actively trying to attack it, and otherwise stay locked on its body\nStay on foot by default, and only get on Torrent briefly to evade specific attacks. A Death Rite Bird can leap a great distance, and the reach on its poker is long enough to clip you even when you're running at full speed on Torrent. The passive damage from its ghostlfame will also knock you off your horse quickly. Even ranged players should try to stay just outside the range of its swings, and keep the flexibility to dodge out of the way when it attacks\n\nMelee Users\nStay close to its hind legs, time your dodges, and get a few swings in after every attack. Don't get greedy and attack more than a few times.\nO Holy Fight: Because Death Rite Birds are both  Undead and weak to Holy damage, melee builds with high Faith will have a particularly easy time defeating them. The Order's Blade sorcery is easy to get and will give your weapon a tremendous damage boost against this boss.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nMany of its abilities can one-shot you if you don't have high HP. Many more deal ghostflame chip damage even if you block, or cause lingering ghostflame that deals damage over time across a wide area. Between this and its ability to close distance rapidly and attack again even as you dodge, it's difficult to find an opportunity to safely attack from a distance. The lingering ghostflame also makes it difficult to stay in the safer areas behind them and near their feet. Play cautiously, focus on survival, and only get in attacks when you're confident you can do so safely.\nIt's Litany: For Faith-based magic builds, Litany of Proper Death will make short work of this fight. Because Death Right Birds are both  Undead and weak to Holy damage, it will do a whopping 1400% extra damage. Just be aware that it will only work when the Death Rite Bird is touching the ground, so time the incantation carefully.\n\nDeath Rite Bird Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nThe Death Rite Bird shares most of its attacks and counters with the Deathbird. Be aware that most of these attacks do additional magic damage and inflict Frostbite.\n\nFlying Sweep\nFlies up and then back down in a corkscrew motion before swinging its poker clockwise\nRun towards it and dodge when you see it tuck its hand towards its body\n\nFlying Swing\nFlies into the air briefly and then dives down, swinging its poker counterclockwise\nRoll forward once you see its hand become level with its body\n\nGhostflame Ignition (Burst)\nSummons an orb of ghostflame as part of its normal Stab or Jab attack, then slams its poker down on this orb creating a devastating ghostflame explosion. Uses this instead of Ghostflame Ignition (Trail) when you're close by after a Stab or Jab\nRoll forward to avoid the explosion and use the opportunity to land a hit\n\nGhostflame Ignition (Trail)\nSummons an orb of ghostflame as part of its normal Stab or Jab attack, then swings its rod clockwise to send a trail of ghostflame towards you. Uses this instead of Ghostflame Ignition (Trail) when you're far away after a Stab or Jab\nDodge to the side, or just run sideways if you notice the orb in time\n\nSpearcall Ritual\nFlies away backwards, then spreads its wings wide, releasing dozens of spears to rain down upon you. Each spear is telegraphed by a glowing white circle on the ground. More spears land in a denser formation closest to the bird and at the beginning of the attack, while they are more spread apart the further away they get and as the attack goes on\nWhen you see the Death Rite Bird flying away, get on Torrent and ride away, give it a chance to do Ancient Death Rancor, then come back and dismount\n\nAncient Death Rancor\nHunches down on the ground, then sends dozens of ghostflame feathers flying towards you. The feathers have decent tracking and can easily stunlock you if you're not careful.\nSprint sideways and dodge any incoming feathers that happen to be in your path. Getting hit by any feathers can stagger you, causing you to get hit by subsequent feathers\n\nExplosive Ghostflame\nHolds its poker upright, charging it, then slams it into the ground imbuing the ground nearby with lingering ghostflame\nMaintain a medium distance away from the bird and then avoid the ghostflame on the ground. Ranged players can use the charge-up time to get in a few hits\n\nDeath Rite Bird Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThe Ravenmount Assassins worship these creatures, modeling their armor after them.\n\nDeath Rite Bird Combo Chart\n\n Death Rite Bird  Academy Gate Town  \n\nDrops\n7,800Ancient Death Rancor\n\nHP\n6,577\n\nElden Ring Death Rite Bird Boss (Academy Gate Town)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Gate Town North\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou cannot summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nDeath Rite Bird Location\nJust south of the Gate Town North Site of Grace. As with most Death Rite Birds, it only appears at night. [Map Link]\nDeath Rite Bird Combat information\n\nHealth: 6,577 HP \nDefense: 110\nDrops 7,800, Ancient Death Rancor\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: Immune\nScarlet Rot: 539 / 829 / 1286\nHemorrhage: Immune\nFrostbite: Immune\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.
