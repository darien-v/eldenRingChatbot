CONTEXT
\n\n Nameless White Mask \n\nLocation\nMohgwyn Dynasty Mausoleum\n\nDrops\n Furlcalling Finger RemedyWar Surgeon Set \n\nNameless White Mask is a Humanoid Enemy Invader in Elden Ring. They are three separate NPC invaders that wear the War Surgeon Set, taking on the appearance of White Mask Varre. They focus on blood loss attacks, using a dagger as well as the Swarm of Flies incantation.\n\nOf the surgeons that were abducted by the Lord of Blood, none were able to tame the accursed blood. None but Varre, that is; but he was an exception.\n\nElden Ring Nameless White Mask Locations\nWhere to Find Nameless White Mask:\n\nAll three Nameless White Mask NPC invaders are in the Mohgwyn Palace underground region. They can be found northwest of the Palace Approach Ledge-Road site of grace, in the blood-filled lake - See the image below for exact locations of these enemies - (Note - These enemies do not spawn instantly and will take around 10 seconds before they begin to load in).\nNameless White Mask (1) Location.

(Tested as of 1.08.)\nDamage: Slash, Standard, Pierce\nInflcits: Hemorrhage\nCan buff himself, if Blood loss happens in his vicinity (White Mask)\nAttacks apply Hemorrhage, maintain your distance and dodge their attacks to ensure that the effect does not get built up all the way.\nTips for the Area - The Blistered Giant Crows and Blistered Strays are plentiful in this area - It is recommended to avoid attracting their attention by sneaking to each of the Nameless White Masks.\nThe boiling blood geysers dotted around the locale will deal damage to both you and any enemies that may pass through them - It is therefore possible to time these eruptions in order to stagger and chip away at your enemy without laying a single blow yourself.\nThe Nameless White Masks will remain defeated and do not need to all be killed in one attempt.\nSpawn at Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance and follow the right wall until point (1). Then follow the left wall until you reach point (3). This is one of the easier paths to kill the southern invader for the War Surgeon Set and avoid detection from other enemies.\nIt can be defeated rather easily by triggering the invasion and then retreating to Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance. Sprint away as soon as it invades and hug the left cliff while returning to avoid enemies. Then climb the ruin stairs and walk up to the cliff. Wait for it to catch up to you and instead of using the stairs, it should be trying to cast magic from below. You can then attack him safely from above using Night Maiden's Mist or other ranged attacks.\n\n Large Preview of Nameless White Mask Enemy Locations:\n\n

QUESTION
Why do the Nameless White Masks only invade if the player has not defeated the area boss Mohg, Lord of Blood?

ANSWER
The Nameless White Masks only invade if the player has not defeated the area boss Mohg, Lord of Blood because they were surgeons abducted by the Lord of Blood, with White Mask Varre being the exception who was able to tame the accursed blood.
