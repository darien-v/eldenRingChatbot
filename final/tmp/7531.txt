The Miquellan Knight's Sword scales primarily with Strength, Faith, and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for dealing Physical Damage, but also can deal Holy Damage during combat.\n\nSword forged by servants of Miquella of the Haligtree, with a design modeled after those carried by Carian knights. Instead of glintstone however, amber from the Haligtree is embedded in the blade. A sumptuous piece, yet it has never been offered to any knight — an ill-starred sword with no master. Skill: Sacred Blade \n\nMiquellan Knight's Sword Location in Elden Ring\nThe Miquellan Knight's Sword can be found in the following location:\n\nElphael, Brace of the Haligtree: Found atop a bell tower. From the Prayer Room site of grace, walk forward into the Haligtree. Not far from the Prayer Room, you will see a Haligtree Soldier sitting down. Before the soldier is a ledge to the right you can walk out on, attached to a tower. Walk on this connector all the way to the tower. Drop down on the tower's ledge, and walk this outer rim to the opposite side. There will be a ladder that takes you up to the sword.\nAlternatively, if you've already unlocked the Haligtree Roots site of grace, simply take the elevator in the adjacent room with the Scarlet Aeonia bloom (not the one in Malenia's boss room). After the elevator stops, get out, walk around the tower and find the ladder. It will take you up to the sword.\n[Elden Ring Map here]\nVideo Location\n\nElden Ring Miquellan Knight's Sword Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Sacred Blade\nThis weapon can't be infused with Ashes of War.\nCan't be enchanted with Magic nor boosted by Consumables.\nMiquellan Knight's Sword can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones\nSell Value:  100\nThis weapon has a unique R2 attack that lunges forward when charged. \nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, Straight Swords poise damage has been reduced only on PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.
