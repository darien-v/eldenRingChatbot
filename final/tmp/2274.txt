CONTEXT
\n\n Incant Scaling \n\nEffect\nThe degree to which incantations increase in power.\n\nIncant Scaling is one of the Statistics in Elden Ring. It is a special Offensive Stat that is used in the calculation that determines how much damage is dealt or healed in Combat by Incantations and is affected primarily by your equipment.\n\nElden Ring Incant Scaling Guide\nIncant Scaling is a special type of damage stat that can be found on Sacred Seals. The higher this statistic, the higher the damage or healing of the incantation used with the seal. Incant Scaling does not increase the duration of buffs or utility incantations, it only affects damage and healing values.\n\nIncant Scaling Calculations\n\nInfo to be added\n\nIncant Scaling and Weapons\nSacred Seals possess the Incant Scaling stat. The value of this stat usually increases in proportion to item upgrade level and Faith, although some sacred seals will also scale with other attributes.\n\nSacred Seals that increase Incant Scaling with more than one attribute have lower faith scaling than sacred seals that use only Faith, but reach similar values of Incant Scaling if both stats are increased instead of just Faith. \n\nThe Golden Order Seal will increase Incant Scaling with both Intelligence and Faith.\nThe Clawmark Seal will increase Incant Scaling with both Strength and Faith.\nThe Dragon Communion Seal will increase Incant Scaling with both Arcane and Faith.\n\nThe Frenzied Flame Seal increases Incant Scaling with Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Faith, but with significantly worse scaling for each individual stat than any other Seal.\n\nElden Ring Incant Scaling Notes & Tips\n\nThe Incant Scaling stat is used to determine damage and healing values of incantations. It will not affect other features of incantations such as duration or range, and it will not affect sorceries.\n\nIncantations that heal over a long period of time, such as Bestial Vitality or Blessing of the Erdtree, will not have their healing affected by this stat.\n\nOnly the Incant Scaling stat of the seal used to cast the spell is used in its calculations. Another seal may be held in the off-hand to provide buffs to particular types of spells, but its Incant Scaling value will not be used.\n\nDamage Types in Elden Ring\n\nCritical Damage  ♦  Fire Damage  ♦  Holy Damage  ♦  Lightning Damage  ♦  Magic Damage  ♦  Pierce Damage  ♦  Slash Damage  ♦  Sorcery Scaling  ♦  Special Weaknesses  ♦  Standard Damage  ♦  Strike Damage\n\n
