CONTEXT
\nNPC Summons in Elden Ring are the summonable cooperator NPCs that can be available in a boss fight. These are different from Spirit Ashes and can be activated by using their summon signs that appear in gold. A number of NPC summons have been added since the 1.03 Patch. These are specific to each boss and may have conditions that must be met before they are available as a summon. These conditions could be simple or part of different questlines and may require you to find each NPC and exhaust their dialogue before they become available. When they become available, their sign will usually be visible just outside of the boss fog gates where they can be summoned. Below is the list of NPC Summons and the conditions required. \nSummoning an NPC will reduce the number of runes you get from killing a boss by 25% and will also increase their health as if you had summoned a co-op player. This may actually make the fight harder as NPC summons are not as powerful as players.\nSee also: \n\nNPCs\nNPC Invaders \n\nAll Summonable NPCs in Elden Ring\nClick on the tabs to view all summons\n\n   Legend Boss Summons \n\n   Great Enemy Summons \n\n   Field Enemy Summons \n\nLegend (Main Boss) Summons\n\nGodrick the Grafted\n\nNepheli Loux:\n\nLocate her at her first location and speak to her three times or exhaust her dialogue to have her available to be summoned\n\nStarscourge Radahn\n\nWitch-Hunter Jerren\n\nJerren joins in on the festival.
