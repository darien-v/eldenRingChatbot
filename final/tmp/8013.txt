CONTEXT
\n\n Latenna the Albinauric \n\nType\nSpirit Summon\n\nFP Cost 74\nHP Cost -\n\nEffect \n\n        Summons the spirit of Latenna the Albinauric \n\nLatenna the Albinauric is a Spirit and Summon in Elden Ring. Latenna the Albinauric is a ranged support unit that deals magic damage with a bow. She acts as a "turret" as she is not able to move from the location she is summoned, unless near an enemy Direwolf which she has the ability to use as a mount. She is able to cast Freezing Mist while mounted, similar to the Albinauric Wolfback Archer enemies encountered in the Consecrated Snowfield.\nLatenna the Albinauric can also be found as an NPC in Elden Ring. For more information, see Latenna.\n\nAshen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of Latenna the Albinauric. \nA rare case of one who chose to become a spirit voluntarily.\nLatenna was renowned as a deft magic archer. But having lost her beloved wolf companion, Lobo, she cannot move from the place where she was summoned.\n\nWhere to find Latenna the Albinauric\nWhere to Find Latenna the Albinauric\n\nLiurnia of the Lakes, Slumbering Wolf's Shack, found at the end of Lakeside Crystal Cave upon defeating the boss.\nIn order for Latenna to be friendly and become a spirit, one has to have the Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right), given to the player by Albus  at the Village of the Albinaurics. [Map Link]\nAlternatively, Latenna may be found dead if one progressed too far and missed out her quest. For this instance, one can still obtain her spirit ashes at the same location by simply picking up the item, but her quest would no longer be doable.\n\nElden Ring Latenna the Albinauric Guide\n\nConsumes Medium FP (74)\nYou must be near a rebirth monument to summon spirits from ashes.\nWhen you are close to a rebirth monument and able to summon, a monument icon will appear on the left side of the screen.\nWhen she finds a target, she shoots three magical arrows at a time, repeatedly and can shoot them very far away.\nIdeally, you should find a sniping perch or vantage point to plop her down on and let her provide sniper fire as you clear the area.\nThough mostly stationary, she does have a tiny amount of mobility. She can inch her way around in response to being attacked, though in rare circumstances she will decide to shuffle around on her own accord. This can make her fall off of a vantage point you've summoned her to.\nHer ability to mount Direwolves is likely an oversight from sharing the same AI as the Albinauric Archers, as she tends to also shoot the wolf due to it still counting as a hostile enemy.\nShe is labeled very situational, mostly good against dragons or in arenas that have elevation. Note: She is not tanky, therefore not good against hyper aggressive enemies.\nCan be useful if one uses Shabriri's Woe in situations where elevation or an otherwise safe spot isn't present. Keep in mind that you will have to stay aggressive towards the boss in order to prevent her from drawing aggro, however.\n\nElden Ring Spirits\n\nAlbinauric Ashes  ♦  Ancestral Follower Ashes  ♦  Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff Ashes  ♦  Archer Ashes  ♦  Avionette Soldier Ashes  ♦  Azula Beastman Ashes  ♦  Banished Knight Engvall Ashes  ♦  Banished Knight Oleg Ashes  ♦  Battlemage Hugues Ashes  ♦  Blackflame Monk Amon Ashes  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Floh  ♦  Clayman Ashes  ♦  Cleanrot Knight Finlay Ashes  ♦  Crystalian Ashes  ♦  Demi-Human Ashes  ♦  Depraved Perfumer Carmaan Ashes  ♦  Dolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet  ♦  Dung Eater Puppet  ♦  Fanged Imp Ashes  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet  ♦  Fire Monk Ashes  ♦  Giant Rat Ashes  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Godrick Soldier Ashes  ♦  Greatshield Soldier Ashes  ♦  Haligtree Soldier Ashes  ♦  Jarwight Puppet  ♦  Kindred of Rot Ashes  ♦  Land Squirt Ashes  ♦  Leyndell Soldier Ashes  ♦  Lhutel the Headless  ♦  Lone Wolf Ashes  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head Ashes  ♦  Man-Serpent Ashes  ♦  Marionette Soldier Ashes  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier Ashes  ♦  Mimic Tear Ashes  ♦  Miranda Sprout Ashes  ♦  Nepheli Loux Puppet  ♦  Nightmaiden & Swordstress Puppets  ♦  Noble Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Nomad Ashes  ♦  Omenkiller Rollo  ♦  Oracle Envoy Ashes  ♦  Page Ashes  ♦  Perfumer Tricia Ashes  ♦  Putrid Corpse Ashes  ♦  Radahn Soldier Ashes  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier Ashes  ♦  Redmane Knight Ogha Ashes  ♦  Rotten Stray Ashes  ♦  Skeletal Bandit Ashes  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman Ashes  ♦  Soldjars of Fortune Ashes  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish Ashes  ♦  Stormhawk Deenh  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Vulgar Militia Ashes  ♦  Wandering Noble Ashes  ♦  Warhawk Ashes  ♦  Winged Misbegotten Ashes\n\n
