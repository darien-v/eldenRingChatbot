The Cinquedea scales primarily with Strength and is a good Weapon for short range melee combat. This dagger is paired with the Quickstep skill to help gain an advantage in position and avoid damage, granting an opening to follow up with a combo of attacks. This dagger also has the unique ability to boost the damage of Bestial Incantations when held. The Cinquedea has extremely high base damage for a dagger while also having good Strength scaling. Overall, it's a surprisingly good Weapon choice for pure Strength builds and Strength / Faith hybrid builds.\n\nShort sword given to high ranking clergymen of Farum Azula.Raises potency of bestial incantations.\nThe design celebrates a beast's five fingers, symbolic of the intelligence once granted upon their kind.\n\nWhere to Find Cinquedea in Elden Ring\nThe Cinquedea weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nLocation: Cinquedea can be found at the bottom of the exterior structure of the Bestial Sanctum, near a broken rat corpse statue. [Map Link]\nTo reach this spot, go to the west cliff outside the sanctum and travel down a series of roots and platforms. Jump down to the outlying branch and continue downward using the ledges and pillars. You can use Rainbow Stones to figure out where to fall from next.\n\nOnce you reach the lowest level, searching this area will grant you this dagger as well as the Dragoncrest Shield Talisman. \n\nElden Ring Cinquedea Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Quickstep\nCinquedea can be upgraded by using Somber Smithing Stones.\nThis weapon cannot be infused with Ashes of War.\nCan't be enchanted with Magic nor boosted with Consumables.\nBuffs damage of Bestial Incantations by 10%, stacking multiplicatively with Clawmark Seal.\nA Cinquedea is a short Italian sword whose name literally translates to "five fingers," originally referencing the width of the blade. \nSell Value:   500\nAn R1 or even R2 can come out so fast after a bestial sling, it's insane.
