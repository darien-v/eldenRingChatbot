CONTEXT
\nLocations in Elden Ring are vast and interconnected. The world of Elden Ring is a persistent Map that can be traversed without loading screens. There are vast landscapes in between the “dungeon-esque” areas. The larger world scale allows for freedom, promotes exploration, and introduces new and exciting mechanics, such as Horse Riding and Mounted Combat. There are no towns and villagers, as the world has collapsed due to the Shattering, but many NPCs and merchants can be found scattered throughout the world. There are plenty of ruins, dungeons and exploration hubs.\nThis page contains a full list of all the locations in the game where players will encounter various enemies, bosses, NPCs, and various events as they progress throughout the game. Locations are divided into Regions, Sub-Regions and Sub-Locations, so make sure to reference our Maps and Interactive Map often when playing. You can find the full list of all the Locations featured in Elden Ring below. For guides, tips, and tricks on locations.\n\nPlease see Recommended Level by Location for tips on when to go where.

Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed, lost their grace, were exiled and labeled as the Tarnished. As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered across the lands and its pieces were picked up by many of the 6 demigods, where they inherited different powers and have physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power.\n\nThe Lands Between is broken into 6 distinct areas that are overseen by a demigod and features a central hub that connects all these 6 areas. According to an interview with Miyazaki, players will have total freedom as to the order they want to tackle for each area, and it is up to the player on how they want to approach it. Apart from that the hub will not be accessible at the beginning of the game, which means you will need to progress the game until you reach the hub area.\nHow do I travel in Elden Ring?\nHorseback riding is a mechanic that is highly featured in Elden Ring. With the use of Mounts, players can use these animals to reach certain points of the world. It is highly recommended by Hidetaka Miyazaki to fully explore The Lands Between to find weapons, magic, and skills that are hidden in the open world. Apart from traveling on foot or by mount, a Fast Travel mechanic is also available to travel long distances.\n\nSpiritsprings\nSpiritsprings can be found next to high cliffs and by stepping on them, you will be launched vertically up in the air to then land over the cliff, gaining a lot of altitude shortly. This will help players avoid taking long stairs to climb up high cliffs. It also can be used as a way to escape from danger.\n\nWeather\nThe Weather in the game will also be dynamic, there's also going to be night and day. Weather in some places can become dangerous and make a hostile environment for the player while roaming around. Night & Day mechanic is also confirmed. Surely some Events will depend on the time of the day.\n\nCentral Hub and Dungeons\nElden Ring features a central hub that leads to the 6 main areas in The Lands Between, but according to Hidetaka Miyazaki, this central hub is not available at the start or beginning of the game, but instead, you will encounter this at a later part of the game through progression. Each main area across The Lands Between is composed of its dungeon and overseeing Demigod (Boss) and it is up to the player on how they want to approach and tackle these areas.\n\nAs you explore The Lands Between, you will come across other catacombs, castles, and fortresses that are outside of the main dungeons where you can discover various secrets and hidden gems such as unique skills that can be learned for your character. Some platforming elements can be seen on the Gameplay Preview launched on November 4th 2021, but not too much.\nSite of Grace\nSites of Grace, work as the classic Bonfires of the Dark Souls Saga, they act as a place of rest for the player. As the world in Elden Ring is much more open than any other previous Souls game, it is possible to get lost or to be confused about where to go next, but Elden Ring offers hints of guidance: Sites of Grace will manifest rays of guiding light in order to guide the player where it's convenient for them to go next. But players are always free to choose whether to follow this guidance or head off to explore in a different direction.\nOn Sites of Grace you can also level up, and replenish some stats and resources. Also whenever you die, you can choose to respawn in any Site of Grace you've already found.\n\nStakes of Marika\nStakes of Marika are statues found usually before fully entering a new location where many enemies are expected, they serve as temporary respawn points. If you happen to die in a zone after visiting a Stakes of Marika closeby, you will be able to choose between reviving on a Site of Grace, or that Stake of Marika. After leaving that location, if you happen to die again, you will no longer be able to revive there.\n\nEffigies of the Martyr\nEffigies of the Martyr are statues usually found in sub-areas to enable area cooperative summoning via the Small Golden Effigy. Martyr Effigies must be activated to enable the use of the Small Golden Effigy.\n\nLocations FAQ Elden Ring\n\nWhere do I go after Weeping Peninsula Elden Ring?\nOnce you get through the initial areas past Limgrave and Stormhill then start to explore the Weeping Peninsula, players might have an invitation to the Roundtable Hold at some point once you rest at ta Site of Grace. This will take you to the hub of the the game and you can begin to introduce yourself to the characters that are stationed there at this time. If Melina has not appeared to you yet at this time you may continue to explore the areas nearby the Weeping Peninsula and you might find yourself in Caelid,\nIf you're following the linear path of the game (in terms of story), by resting at the Site of Grace after defeating Margit the Fell Omen who is guarding the main gate of Stormveil Castle will have Melina appear and bring you to the Roundtable Hold. On the other hand, if you have been exploring and wandering into further regions (at some point upon accidentally reaching the region of Caelid), Melina will appear and invite you over to visit the Roundtable Hold.\nEven if your interaction with Melina has not occurred yet, your next location after Stormveil Castle will be at Liurnia of the Lakes. This is part of the natural progression of the game and easily the next area because of its proximity to the Weeping Peninsula and Limgrave. It has a starting area just northwest of Limgrave.  It can be initially accessed via the passage beneath Godrick the Grafted's throne room in Stormveil Castle, or by following a narrow cliffside path around the east edge of the castle in northern Stormhill.  \nHow do I get to the Second Snow Area in Elden Ring?\nThe second snow region is known as the Consecrated Snowfields. It is a secret area on the lower plains of the Mountaintops of the Giants. As shown through the instructions above, you will need to take the Grand Lift of Rold to this location. However you will be required to have both parts of the Haligtree Secret Medallion which will require you to have explored the Mountaintops of the Gaints first. Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right) is found in Liurnia of the Lakes. Haligtree Secret Medallion (Left) is found in Mountaintops of the Giants.\n\n Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right): Hit Albus, who is disguised as a pot past the Perfumer guarding the path up from the Village of the Albinaurics Site of Grace in the swamp caves west of Liurnia of the Lakes. [Map Link] \nHaligtree Secret Medallion (Left): Located in Castle Sol- found on the roof of the tower in the northeast, accessible after defeating Commander Niall. [Elden Ring Map Link]\n\nOnce you have both pieces of the medallion, go to the Grand Lift of Rold and select "Hoist secret medallion" (make sure your action is "Hoist secret medallion" and not "Hoist medallion") to brandish your secret one.\nHow do you get to the Temple of Blood in Elden Ring? \nThe Temple of Blood is also known as the Dynasty Mausoleum in Elden Ring. This is where Mohg, Lord of Blood will be.

[Elden Ring Map Here] \nIf you take the waygate from the Consecrated Snowfield, you will find yourself in a cave. Head out of the cave and this is Mohgwyn Palace. Make your way down and you will be heading directly west through the Bloody water until you see the arches that will signify that you have reached the Dynasty Mausoleum. To reach Mohg, Lord of Blood head up through the stairs until you reach the temple structure and head in. There will be a number of enemies along the way. Continue to head west and you will eventually find the doorway leading out. In this next area, there will be a lever where you can activate the lift to reach the Boss arena. \n\nHow do I get into the Golden Capital Elden Ring?\nThe Golden capital is also known as Leyndell, Royal Capital. In order to reach this area. First, you need to find the  Grand Lift of Dectus which is found between Liurnia of the Lakes and the Altus Plateau However, on your first visit, the lift is sealed by four Guardian Statues. It requires a special artifact in order to activate. This artifact is the Dectus Medallion which is made up of two halves found in separate locations. The Dectus Medallion (Left) can be found in Mistwood, inside a chest atop the tallest tower in Fort Haight to the east. [Map Link] The Dectus Medallion (Right) can be found in Dragonbarrow, inside a chest atop the eastern tower in Fort Faroth to the east. [Map Link] Once both halves are obtained, approach the platform once more to hoist the whole medallion and raise the lift, taking you to the Altus Plateau and the Capital will be just Northeast from here.\nThe Leyndell, Royal Capital northeastern gate is accessible to players who have gathered two Great Runes, but cannot be accessed without visiting the Roundtable Hold. You can begin entry through the sides of the capital walls from the East Capital Rampart Site of Grace [Map Coordinates Here].

This area can only be accessed after progressing through enough of the storyline. Once you commit to "the cardinal sin" by talking to Melina from the Site of Grace found at the Forge of the Giants, your character falls asleep during a cinematic and then wakes up in Crumbling Farum Azula. Alternatively, if you've interacted with the Three Fingers, Melina does not help you get there. Instead, while resting at the Forge of the Giants Site of Grace, select the 'Listen to the sound of the flames' option and a different cutscene will play, but take to you to the same spot in Crumbling Farum Azula.\nHow do you get to Tornado City?\nTornado City is also known as the Crumbling Farum Azula in Elden Ring. Follow the instructions above to reach the Tornado city.\nHow do I get to Frenzy Door Elden Ring?\nThis area is accessible from this location: Subterranean Shunning Grounds.The door is at the lowest part of this location. You may follow the walkthrough down until you reach Mohg, the Omen. From here, you will need to return to the back of his boss room. Loot the chests, activate and use the Cathedral of the Forsaken Site of Grace and rest. Attack the wall behind the chest to take down the wall and reveal the passage. Here is where you will need to use your platforming skills descend. leading to the Frenzied Flame Proscription, the final location for Hyetta's questline.
