CONTEXT
\nCrossbows are a type of Weapon in Elden Ring. Crossbows are ranged weapons that can be used to inflict high damage on hostile characters from afar. Unlike Bows, they must be loaded before firing each shot, but in turn can fire immediately without a draw animation if the weapon is loaded beforehand. They grant no guard protection, encouraging users to maintain distance from advancing enemies.  Crossbows require Bolts as ammunition.\nCrossbows can not be given new Ashes of War, greased, spell buffed, or given new affinities.\n See also: Ballistas\nUsing Crossbows in Elden Ring\nCrossbows have a different control scheme than either melee weapons or other types of Bow. You have to ready the Crossbow before you fire each bolt, for a total of two presses of the attack button per shot.\n\nReady Crossbow\nR1 or R2\nRB or RT\nLeft Click\n\nWhen Ready\n\nShoot Bolt 1\nR1\nRB\nLeft Click\n\nShoot Bolt 2\nR2\nRT\nShift + Left Click\n\nWhen Two-Handing\n\nFirst-Person Aim\nHold L1\nHold LB\nHold Right Click\n\nShoot Bolt 1 shoots the bolt type in the slot on the left in your equipment screen, and Shoot Bolt 2 shoots the type on the right.\n\nCrossbow Notes & Tips\n\nUnlike bows which needs to perform loading, drawing, and shooting all in a single motion when firing, a crossbow can be loaded and drawn first without shooting. A crossbow will retain its drawn state even when switching to another weapon, and it will only lose its draw when the crossbow is unequipped from the player's weapon slots. This makes crossbows faster than bows at "quick-draw" shooting, as a player can preload a crossbow and keep it drawn before any enemy encounter, and then the weapon can fire immediately instead of needing to load and draw first. A player can even switch from a melee weapon to a pre-loaded crossbow and fire a shot instantly.\nIn order to manually aim with a crossbow, players must two-hand the weapon. \nCrossbows do not have stat scaling, only stat requirements for use. While this limits the effective upper range of damage they can do compared to bows, it does allow any build to use crossbows effectively provided they meet the stat requirements. \nWhen using a crossbow while galloping on horseback, the player can fire their crossbow while in mid-air without unloading the crossbow as firing it normally would, allowing the player to fire their crossbow a second time immediately upon landing, without needing to reload (the Pulley Crossbow is excluded). This behavior is similar to the rapid follow-up shot the a player can achieve with a shortbow after jumping and firing it, albeit with stricter requirements.\n\nElden Ring Crossbows\n\nAll Weapons\n\nWeapons by Type   \n\nAxes\nBallistae\nBows\nClaws\nColossal Swords\nColossal Weapons\nCrossbows\nCurved Greatswords\nCurved Swords\nDaggers\nFists\nFlails\nGlintstone Staffs\nGreataxes\nGreatbows\nGreat Hammers\nGreat Spears\nGreatswords\nHalberds\nHammers\nHeavy Thrusting Swords\nKatanas\nLight Bows\nReapers\nSacred Seals\nSpears\nStraight Swords\nThrusting Swords\nTorches\nTwinblades\nWhips\n\nElden Ring Bows Base Values\n\nQuick Search of All Weapons\n\n Name \nPhy\nRng\nMag\nFire\nLigh\nHoly\nCritBoost\nStr\nDex\nInt\nFai\nArc\nWgt\nSkill\n\nSoldier's Crossbow\n 54 - \n 42 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 10 - \n 8 - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n3.5 \n - Kick \n\nLight Crossbow\n 58 - \n 42 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 12 - \n 8 - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n4.0\n - Kick \n\nHeavy Crossbow\n 64 - \n 42 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 14 - \n 10 - \n  - - \n  - - \n  - - \n5.5\n  - Kick \n\nArbalest\n  69 - \n 42 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 18 - \n 12 - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n6.0\n - Kick \n\nCrepus's Black-Key Crossbow\n 68 - \n 47 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 14 - \n 16 - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n5.0\n - Kick \n\nPulley Crossbow\n 65 - \n 42 \n - - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 16 - \n 16 - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n4.0\n - Kick \n\nFull Moon Crossbow\n 50 - \n42\n 50 - \n - - \n - - \n - - \n 100 - \n 10 - \n 10 - \n 14 - \n - - \n - - \n4.0\n - Kick \n\nElden Ring Bows Max Standard Values\n\nQuick Search of All Weapons\n ​ \n\nName\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nCri\nSta\nStr\nDex\nInt\nFai\nArc\nAny\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nBst\nRst\nWgt\n\nArbalest\n308\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n68\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n6\n\nCrepus's Black-Key Crossbow\n238\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n64\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5\n\nFull Moon Crossbow\n175\n175\n-\n-\n-\n100\n60\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4\n\nHeavy Crossbow\n288\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n66\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5.5\n\nLight Crossbow\n260\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n60\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4\n\nPulley Crossbow\n146\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n60\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4\n\nSoldier's Crossbow\n240\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n56\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3.5\n\n
