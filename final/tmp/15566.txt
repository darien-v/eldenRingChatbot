\n\n Mohgwyn Palace \n\nMohgwyn Palace Map & Fragments\nSites of Grace & Sub-Locations\nAll NPCs & Merchants\nAll Items, Equipment & Magic\nAll Enemies & Bosses\n\nMohgwyn Palace is a Location in Elden Ring. The Mohgwyn Palace region is found beneath Caelid, but is only accessible from a gateway teleporter in the frozen west of Consecrated Snowfield (northwest of the Yelough Anix Ruins and west of where the Sanguine Noble invades you) or by using the Pureblood Knight's Medal given by White Mask Varré at the end of his questline.\n\nIn the lightless depths lies the grave of an ancient civilization. It is here Mohg, the Lord of Blood, is building his palace, to be the seat of his coming dynasty named Mohgwyn. And whatever nightmares that may bring.\n\nMohgwyn Palace Map & Map Fragments\n\nMap Mohgwyn Palace: Found on a corpse on the stairway leading to the palace, past some Albinaurics that summon giant skeletons. [Elden Ring Map Link]\n\nThe Waygate Teleporter to Mohgwyn Palace is found northwest of the Yelough Anix Ruins in the Consecrated Snowfield. The Waygate is inactive until after you kill the Sanguine Noble NPC, who invades nearby. [Elden Ring Map Link] Northwest of Yelough ruins is a circular formation visible on the map, which is a rocky trunk-like spire.  Directly west of that circular spire on the map is the teleporter, but you just drop down a couple ledges near some white logs that form a ramp.\n[overall map goes here]\n\nElden Ring Mohgwyn Palace Sites of Grace & Sub-Locations\nSites of Grace\n\nPalace Approach Ledge-Road.

The caves here are linear, so simply follow the path out and down and you'll be able to grab a Golden Rune (11) and get to the Palace Approach Ledge-Road Site of Grace. Make your way northwest where the slope is littered with Albinaurics and collect a Golden Rune (11), a Smithing Stone (6), and five Bloodroses on the way down. At the bottom, you'll emerge into the main blood-filled lake of Mohgwyn Palace.\nIf you'd like to grab the map fragment for this area to make navigation easier, keep heading north-northwest until you get to a section with three hunting horn-wielding Albinaurics who can summon large spectral skeletons. Once you get past them, head west to find a ruin, and the single corpse sitting in the middle here has the Map (Mohgwyn Palace). Head up the stairs to quickly grab the Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Site of Grace.\nWith our newfound map, it's time to get looting. Back from the slope, you descended earlier from the Palace Approach Ledge-Road, head east to reach the southern section of the lake. On your way, you're likely going to get invaded by a Nameless White Mask. Three of these NPC invaders will attack you at different areas in the blood lake. They have quick attacks and have access to a strong bleed spell that you should try to avoid as best as you can. On the southwestern side of the lake, you'll be able to find the Haligdrake Talisman (+2) and a Ghost Glovewort (9) among some graves by the cliff. In the southeast, on the other hand, you can find a Golden Seed and the Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (24).\nHead back to the northern part of the lake, where you'll find a Smithing Stone (7), Smithing Stone (8), and Golden Rune (12) on the western side. In the middle, in front of a large rock pillar is a Hero's Rune (4). Along the eastern walls are small caves, each filled with loot. In the first cave (from the south) is a Somber Smithing Stone (9) and a Teardrop Scarab that drops the Ash of War: Blood Tax. The second cave is guarded by a few Albinaurics and has a Ghost Glovewort (8) and the Swarm of Flies incantation. The third cave, also guarded by some enemies, houses a Smithing Stone (6) and Golden Rune (13). Hug the eastern wall north and you'll eventually find a Rune Arc.\nMake your way back to the Dynasty Mausoleum Site of Grace and head up the stairs in the southwest. In this area, you'll be encountering a bunch of Putrid Corpses. Many of them are fairly docile, not minding even a shoulder bump, while some will run at you and attempt to explode in your face. Whether you decide to take them out or leave them alone, follow the linear path here, grabbing a Smithing Stone (7), Numen's Rune, Stanching Boluses, and eight Bloodroses on your way. \nYou'll eventually get to a group of Putrid Corpses praising the sky in front of a dark doorway. This doorway leads into a very dark cave, so get your lantern or torch ready. At various points, while exploring the cave, you'll get ambushed by Sanguine Nobles. If you die by their hand, you can respawn at the Stake of Marika right outside the cave's doorway. At the first cave split that you encounter, a Sanguine Noble will appear. Head down the south split before heading north to find the Imprisoned Merchant.\nWhen you head north, you'll immediately find a Lord's Rune in front of you. Continue northeast to get to a ledge overlooking a Great Ghost Glovewort. If you shine your torch down, you'll see a hoard of Putrid Corpses gathering around it. None of them, in particular, are the 'explode in your face' kind, so you can simply run past them to grab the glovewort. Next, head west, where you'll encounter another Sanguine Noble and a Smithing Stone (8) among some gravestones. Continue following the path, picking up the Ghost Glovewort (9) on the way, and you'll eventually emerge outside to the Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint Site of Grace.\nRight ahead are a group of Albinaurics and a Sanguine Noble facing up towards a large statue. You can take them out one by one since they don't seem to have situational awareness Attacking one Albirnauric triggers all of them to be hostile. Right in front of the statue is a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone and if you take a peek on the lower ledge behind the statue, you'll find a Golden Rune (13). From here, look down over the cliff to see a corpse holding a Golden Seed that you can jump to. Watch the pit between your self and the rocky platform. From here, you can either go back the long way or fast travel. As of July 2022 the corpse described above is visible but does not hold any item. It is unknown if this true at all times, or if there is a trigger variable in the individual playthrough (total seeds already collected, etc.) If the corpse has no item feel free to forego the jump & skip to the paragraph below.\n\nTurn around, facing northwest, and take the lift ahead up to a large ruined temple. When you walk in a cutscene plays and the fight against Mohg, Lord of Blood commences. Defeat him and you'll be rewarded with the Remembrance of the Blood Lord and Mohg's Great Rune. The Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace spawns here after his defeat as well.\n\nElden Ring Mohgwyn Palace Maps and Notes\nHow do you get to the Temple of Blood Elden Ring?\nThe Temple of Blood is also known as the Dynasty Mausoleum in Elden Ring. This is where Mohg, Lord of Blood will be. In order to reach this location, ensure you made your way to the underground first and reach Mogwyn Palace which is accessed rom a gateway teleporter [Elden Ring Map Link]  in the frozen west of Consecrated Snowfield (northwest of the Yelough Anix Ruins and west of where the Sanguine Noble invades you) or by using the Pureblood Knight's Medal given by White Mask Varré at the end of his questline. White Mask Varre will give you this item once you have completed the 3 invasions required for his questline to advance.He will give you the Medal after the reusable Bloody Finger, exhausting his dialogue is necessary. [Elden Ring Map Here] \nOnce you reach the underground, you will find yourself in a cave. Head out of the cave and this is Mohgwyn Palace. Make your way down and you will be heading directly west through the Bloody water until you see the arches that will signify that you have reached the Dynasty Mausoleum. To reach Mohg, Lord of Blood head up through the stairs until you reach the temple structure and head in. There will be a number of enemies along the way. Continue to head west and you will eventually find the doorway leading out. In this next area, there will be a lever where you can activate the lift to reach the Boss arena. \nOther Mohgwyn Palace Notes\n\nOther Notes go here\n\nAll Elden Ring Locations\n\nAbandoned Cave  ♦  Academy Crystal Cave  ♦  Academy Gate Town  ♦  Aeonia Swamp  ♦  Ailing Village  ♦  Ainsel River  ♦  Ainsel River Main  ♦  Ainsel River Well  ♦  Albinauric Rise  ♦  Altus Plateau  ♦  Altus Tunnel  ♦  Apostate Derelict  ♦  Artist's Shack  ♦  Auriza Hero's Grave  ♦  Auriza Side Tomb  ♦  Bellum Church  ♦  Bellum Highway  ♦  Bestial Sanctum  ♦  Black Knife Catacombs  ♦  Boilprawn Shack  ♦  Bridge of Sacrifice  ♦  Caelem Ruins  ♦  Caelid  ♦  Caelid Catacombs  ♦  Caelid Colosseum  ♦  Caelid Waypoint Ruins  ♦  Callu Baptismal Church  ♦  Capital Outskirts  ♦  Caria Manor  ♦  Carian Study Hall  ♦  Carriage  ♦  Castle Morne  ♦  Castle Sol  ♦  Cathedral of Manus Celes  ♦  Cathedral of the Forsaken  ♦  Cave of the Forlorn  ♦  Chapel of Anticipation  ♦  Chelona's Rise  ♦  Church of Dragon Communion  ♦  Church of Elleh  ♦  Church of Inhibition  ♦  Church of Irith  ♦  Church of Pilgrimage  ♦  Church of Repose  ♦  Church of the Plague  ♦  Church of Vows  ♦  Cliffbottom Catacombs  ♦  Colosseums  ♦  Consecrated Snowfield Catacombs  ♦  Converted Fringe Tower  ♦  Converted Tower  ♦  Corpse-Stench Shack  ♦  Craftsman's Shack  ♦  Cuckoo's Evergaol  ♦  Deathtouched Catacombs  ♦  Deep Ainsel Well  ♦  Deep Siofra Well  ♦  Deeprooth Depths  ♦  Demi-Human Forest Ruins  ♦  Divine Tower of Caelid  ♦  Divine Tower of East Altus  ♦  Divine Tower of Limgrave  ♦  Divine Tower of Liurnia  ♦  Divine Tower of West Altus  ♦  Dragon-Burnt Ruins  ♦  Dragonbarrow  ♦  Dragonbarrow Cave  ♦  East Windmill Pasture  ♦  Effigies of the Martyr  ♦  Elden Throne  ♦  Eternal City  ♦  First Church of Marika  ♦  Flame Peak  ♦  Forbidden Lands  ♦  Forest Lookout Tower  ♦  Forge of the Giants  ♦  Forlorn Hound Evergaol  ♦  Forsaken Ruins  ♦  Fort Faroth  ♦  Fort Gael  ♦  Fort Haight  ♦  Fort Laiedd  ♦  Fourth Church of Marika  ♦  Frenzied Flame Proscription  ♦  Frenzied Flame Village  ♦  Frenzy-Flaming Tower  ♦  Fringefolk Hero's Grave  ♦  Gael Tunnel  ♦  Gaol Cave  ♦  Gatefront Ruins  ♦  Gelmir Hero's Grave  ♦  Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave  ♦  Golden Lineage Evergaol  ♦  Gowry's Shack  ♦  Grand Cloister  ♦  Grand Lift of Dectus  ♦  Grand Lift of Rold  ♦  Groveside Cave  ♦  Guardians' Garrison  ♦  Hallowhorn Grounds  ♦  Heretical Rise  ♦  Hermit's Shack  ♦  Hermit Merchant's Shack  ♦  Hermit Village  ♦  Hidden Path to the Haligtree  ♦  Highroad Cave  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Highway Lookout Tower (Liurnia)  ♦  Impaler's Catacombs  ♦  Isolated Divine Tower  ♦  Isolated Merchant's Shack (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Jarburg  ♦  Kingsrealm Ruins  ♦  Lake of Rot  ♦  Lakeside Crystal Cave  ♦  Laskyar Ruins  ♦  Lenne's Rise  ♦  Leyndell Catacombs  ♦  Leyndell Colosseum  ♦  Leyndell Royal Capital  ♦  Limgrave  ♦  Limgrave Colosseum  ♦  Limgrave Tunnels  ♦  Lord Contender's Evergaol  ♦  Lunar Estate Ruins  ♦  Lux Ruins  ♦  Malefactor's Evergaol  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Altus Plateau)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Caelid)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Consecrated Snowfield)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Dragonbarrow)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Northeast)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Liurnia Southwest)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mistwood)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mountaintops East)  ♦  Minor Erdtree (Mt.
