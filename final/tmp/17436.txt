Skeletons are literal bare-bone creatures, always hostile and often moving in packs. It is very common for them to ambush their preys, by acting as lifeless corpses or hiding underwater or underground. They will not die upon defeat, making them able to re-take their previous shape and keep on fighting. In order to avoid this, players should also attack their remains even after these creatures are defeated.\n\nSkeletons Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to Find Skeletons:\n\nPlayers can encounter Skeletons in the beaches and dungeons of Limgrave, and in the graveyards.\nThey can be found in the Deathtouched Catacombs.\nLocated roaming the graves of Liurnia of The Lakes.\nCan be found in Wyndham Catacombs.\nWeeping Peninsula.

Once defeated, the glowing remains they leave behind must be hit to avoid them reforming and attacking again.\nIf a Skeleton is killed by a weapon, spell, skill, or consumable that's strong against  Undead, it will not resurrect.\nNecromancers, which can only be found in the Black Knife Catacombs, can each continuously resurrect certain nearby Skeletons (unless they are killed by certain Sacred weapons or weapon skills) until they are killed, at which point each Skeleton they can resurrect will disintegrate.\nThe Skeletons in the Capital Outskirts can hover up into the air in a t-pose and breathe black smoke downwards, which does continuous damage until it dissipates.\nIn the Deathtouched Catacombs, Skeletal Swordsmen can wield an Iron Roundshield but instead will drop a Scripture Wooden Shield.\nThose found in Crumbling Farum Azula are skeletons of Beastmen, though they wield the weapons of the human skeletons, not the weapons of Beastmen. The ones with a Glaive or an Executioner's Greataxe can use a Fire Breath attack. It is not clear why the drop Human Bone Shards.\nAccording to the description of the Skeletal Militiaman Ashes, Skeletal Militiamen "live in Death, and will continue to rise again until properly finished off.This is the grotesque fate of those who come into contact with Deathroot."\nAccording to the description of Skeletal Bandit Ashes, Deathroot appeared in the Lands Between after Godwyn's assassination took place, and "Those Who Live in Death" followed. "Those Who Live in Death" includes Skeletons.\nAccording to the description of the Grave Scythe, Skeletal Mages are "the aged grave keepers who tend the forgotten graveyards throughout the Lands Between." They can summon black-and-white wraiths, like Skeletal Snails.\nThe description of the Sun Realm Shield says, "Shield of honor depicting a city crowned by the sun.It has seen better days.Much like the wear upon the shield, the Seat of the Sun is long faded away."Neither the Seat of the Sun nor the Sun Realm is mentioned in the rest of the game. The Sun is mentioned various times in the game, almost always in reference to it being eclipsed. A cartoonish Sun is also visible on the "watch" in the bottom-right corner of the in-game map screen. There is still a Sun in The Lands Between, but it is usually obscured from the view of the player, except in a few locations. This is presumably due to the light pollution caused by the Erdtree's gross incandescence. Therefore, it is possible that this city and its soldiers predate the Erdtree.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nElden Ring Creatures & Enemies\n\nAbductor Virgin  ♦  Abnormal Stone Cluster  ♦  Albinauric  ♦  Albinauric Wolfback Archer  ♦  Anastasia Tarnished-Eater  ♦  Ancestral Follower  ♦  Ancestral Follower Shaman  ♦  Avionette Soldier  ♦  Azula Beastman  ♦  Baleful Shadow  ♦  Banished Knight  ♦  Basilisk  ♦  Battlemage  ♦  Bear  ♦  Blackflame Monk  ♦  Bloody Finger Nerijus  ♦  Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin  ♦  Boar  ♦  Broken Statue  ♦  Burning Slug  ♦  Celebrant  ♦  Chanting Winged Dame  ♦  Chariot  ♦  Chief Guardian Arghanthy  ♦  Clayman  ♦  Colossal Fingercreeper  ♦  Commoner  ♦  Construct  ♦  Crab  ♦  Crystal Snail  ♦  Crystal Sorcerer  ♦  Deer  ♦  Demi-Human  ♦  Demi-Human Queen  ♦  Depraved Perfumer  ♦  Direwolf  ♦  Dog  ♦  Duelist  ♦  Eagle  ♦  Edgar the Revenger  ♦  Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm  ♦  Exile Soldier  ♦  Fallen Hawks Soldier  ♦  Farum Azula Dragon  ♦  Festering Fingerprint Vyke  ♦  Fingercreeper  ♦  Fire Monk  ♦  Fire Prelate  ♦  Flame Guardian  ♦  Frenzied Villager  ♦  Giant Ant  ♦  Giant Bat  ♦  Giant Crab  ♦  Giant Crayfish  ♦  Giant Dog  ♦  Giant Dragonfly  ♦  Giant Land Octopus  ♦  Giant Land Squirt  ♦  Giant Miranda Sprout  ♦  Giant Rat  ♦  Giant Skeletal Slime  ♦  Giant Skeleton (Spirit)  ♦  Glintstone Dragon  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer  ♦  Godrick Foot Soldier  ♦  Golem  ♦  Great Horned Tragoth  ♦  Great-Jar Warrior  ♦  Guardian  ♦  Guillemot  ♦  Haligtree Foot Soldier  ♦  Haligtree Knight  ♦  Haligtree Soldier  ♦  High Page  ♦  Highwayman  ♦  Inaba, Disciple of Okina  ♦  Inquisitor Ghiza  ♦  Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood  ♦  Kaiden Sellsword  ♦  Knight of Zamor  ♦  Land Octopus  ♦  Land Squirt  ♦  Lazuli Sorcerer  ♦  Lesser Alabaster Lord  ♦  Lesser Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Lesser Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Lesser Burial Watchdog  ♦  Lesser Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Lesser Dragonkin Soldier (Spirit)  ♦  Lesser Fingercreeper  ♦  Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)  ♦  Lesser Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Lesser Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Lesser Omenkiller  ♦  Lesser Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Lesser Runebear  ♦  Lesser Sanguine Noble  ♦  Lesser Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Lesser Wormface  ♦  Leyndell Foot Soldier  ♦  Leyndell Knight  ♦  Leyndell Soldier  ♦  Lion Guardian  ♦  Living Jar  ♦  Lone Wolf  ♦  Mad Tongue Alberich  ♦  Maleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan  ♦  Malformed Star  ♦  Man-Serpent  ♦  Mausoleum Foot Soldier  ♦  Mausoleum Knight  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier  ♦  Miner  ♦  Miranda Sprout  ♦  Misbegotten  ♦  Monstrous Crow  ♦  Mounted Knight  ♦  Nameless White Mask  ♦  Night Maiden  ♦  Noble Sorcerer  ♦  Nomad  ♦  Nox Monk  ♦  Nox Swordstress  ♦  Old Knight Istvan  ♦  Omen  ♦  Oracle Envoy  ♦  Oracle Envoy Giant  ♦  Owl  ♦  Page  ♦  Preceptor Miriam  ♦  Putrid Avatar  ♦  Putrid Corpse  ♦  Radahn Foot Soldier  ♦  Radahn Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Foot Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Knight  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier  ♦  Recusant Henricus  ♦  Redmane Knight  ♦  Revenant  ♦  Rileigh the Idle  ♦  Rotten Duelist  ♦  Scarlet Rot Zombie  ♦  School of Graven Mages  ♦  Serpent Snail  ♦  Servant of Rot  ♦  Sheep  ♦  Silver Tear  ♦  Skeletal Bandit  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman  ♦  Skeletal Slime  ♦  Skeletal Snail  ♦  Skeleton Mage  ♦  Slug  ♦  Soldier  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish  ♦  Spirit NPC  ♦  Springhare  ♦  Starcaller  ♦  Tanith's Knight  ♦  Teardrop Scarab  ♦  Thorn Sorcerer  ♦  Troll  ♦  Troll Knight  ♦  Turtle  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer  ♦  Unobtainable Items  ♦  Vargram the Raging Wolf  ♦  Vulgar Militant  ♦  Wandering Nobles  ♦  Warhawk  ♦  Wild Mouflon  ♦  Wraith Caller\n\n
