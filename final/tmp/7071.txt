CONTEXT
\n\n Thops \n\nLocation\nChurch of Irith in Liurnia of the Lakes\n\nRole\nSorcery Student\n\nVoiced by\nMathew Morgan\n\nThops is an NPC in Elden Ring. Thops is a student at the Academy of Raya Lucaria. He can teach some rudimentary sorceries, provided you can spare a small donation of Runes first.\n\nFor a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.\n\nThops Location in Elden Ring\nThops can be found at Church of Irith. [Map Link]\n\nThis NPC will move elsewhere and become unavailable as a merchant if given the second Academy Glintstone Key that you acquire.\nMap Coordinates for Thops's location after giving him an Academy Glintstone Key. He can be found dead within Raya Lucaria Academy, nearby the Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace. \n\nTo find his body: From the Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace, exit the room via the doorway you originally entered it, towards the cavern with the large wheel with rideable platforms. Hug the right wall to find him, a few steps from the doorway.\n\nYou can offer to give Thops the first Academy Glintstone Key you find, but he will not accept it, since he knows that you need it to access the academy. To continue his quest line, you must give him the Academy Glintstone Key that you can find within Raya Lucaria Academy.\nThis merchant can be fought and slain.\nDoing his quest will reward you with the Erudition Gesture, which is somewhat useful for solving one magic tower puzzle, and vital for completing another (provided that you also have one of the stone crowns worn by high ranking students of Raya Lucaria Academy).\nIf he is slain, Thops will drop 500 Runes, Thops’s Bell Bearing, and an Academy Glintstone Staff.\nIf found dead at Raya Lucaria Academy, you can acquire Thops's Bell Bearing, an Academy Glintstone Staff, and the sorcery Thops's Barrier from his body.\nAfter Thops leaves the Church of Irith, a new Teardrop Scarab can be found near where he once sat. Slaying it will reward the player with the Ash of War: Thops's Barrier. \n\nElden Ring Thops Shop\n\nItem Name\nItem Type\nPurchase Value\nStock\n\nGlintstone Pebble\nSorcery\n1000\n1\n\nGlintstone Arc\nSorcery\n1500\n1\n\nStarlight\nSorcery\n2500\n1\n\nTHOPS QUESTLINE: HOW TO COMPLETE THOPS' QUEST\nAfter speaking with Thops and donating 10 Runes to him, Thops will share that it is his dearest wish to return to Raya Lucaria Academy to continue his studies in glintstone sorcery. Once you have obtained the Academy Glintstone Key found within Raya Lucaria Academy, you can then give it to Thops. Doing so will reward you with the Erudition Gesture. This gesture can be used to solve a couple puzzles found elsewhere (provided that you also have one of the stone crowns worn by high ranking students of Raya Lucaria Academy). Afterwards, Thops will leave for Raya Lucaria Academy.\nYou can later find him dead, sitting at a desk just outside the room containing the Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace within Raya Lucaria Academy. On his body is the sorcery Thops's Barrier, an Academy Glintstone Staff, and Thops's Bell Bearing. You can bring the Bell Bearing to the Twin Maiden Husks at the Roundtable Hold to unlock his inventory for purchase there.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Thops\nIntroduction\n\n"You're Tarnished, aren't you?Then, perhaps you could spare some runes?Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge."\n\nDonate 10 Runes\n\n"Well, bless you, bless you.You are a true saint.My name is Thops.Presuming you're interested, I can teach you sorceries, as promised.Only, none of them are particularly great..."\n\nAttempting to give a scroll\n\n"Oh, did I not mention?I'm a bluntstone. I don't even have a pebble's worth of power.So I'm afraid I can't help you decipher the scroll.I'm sorry I'm so useless. I truly am."\n\nOn Academy Glintstone Key\n\n"Why not find yourself a glintstone key?Without one, you can't pass through the academy, and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps...Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient - would you consider donating it to me?I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery.But still, my place is at the academy..."\n(If handed Academy Glintstone Key)"Are you certain? You re willing to give your glintstone key to me? ...My oh my! Thank you, thank you dearly.Now I can go back to the academy. To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars".\n"Thank you dearly. With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria.Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit? Who knows, I may be a decorated sorcerer by then! Ha ha!".\n\nSmall Talk\n\n(If you don't take any Sorcery from him)"Apologies, friend.I'm afraid my meagre sorceries are no match for your generosity.Oh, right.I can tell you what I know about this place. That should help a bit.You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water?That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries.Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now.After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering, the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.As you might have guessed, the seals are still active, making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key.When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning."\n(If you buy his sorceries)For learning my paltry sorceries.I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher.\n(About Sellen)"You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen?Well, that is something.Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy.I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us.But Sellen was expelled from the academy.Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.I still don't believe the accusations.The illustrious Sellen would never do such things..."\n\nVisit\n\nBack to learn another? Why, of course.\n\nWhen attacked\n\n(Entering combat) There's no getting through to you, is there.\n(Upon killing the player) ... Why on earth...\n\nUpon defeat\n\nOh, Raya...Lucaria... The home of my studies...\n\nElden Ring Thops Notes & Trivia\n\nIf provoked, Thops wields a Carian Glintstone Staff, which he uses to cast Glintstone Pebble. Interestingly, the staff he uses in combat is different from the staff he drops on death.\nThops is voiced by Matthew Morgan, who also voiced Domhnall of Zena in Dark Souls.\nThops will not move to the Raya Lucaria Academy if he is made hostile after giving him the Academy Glintstone Key, although he will move if you then seek atonement at the Church of Vows.\nThere are actually two versions of the Academy Glintstone Key. The second one is found within Raya Lucaria Academy itself and is the only one that can be given to Thops to continue his quest.\nOf the sorceries that Thops can sell, only Starlight is unique to his inventory. Glintstone Pebble and Glintstone Arc can also be purchased from another NPC in the Limgrave region. Note that owning multiple copies of the same spell does not offer any benefits.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
