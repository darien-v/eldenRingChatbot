\n\n Troll \n\nLocation\nThroughout the Lands Between\n\nDrops\n\n 1000 - 7800 RunesEye of YeloughArteria Leaf Troll Knight’s Sword\n\nTrolls are Giant Humanoid Enemies in Elden Ring. Large and sturdy, these creatures are found everywhere in the Lands Between, serving as guards, knights, and even as beasts of burden.\n\n The lesser giants who fought for the Erdtree during the War against the Giants long ago. Though the giants have lost their minds, they stay inseparable from their swords that are in sad shape—such that the gold plating had flaked away.\n\nTroll Location in Elden Ring\nWhere to Find Trolls:\n\nTrolls are found almost everywhere in the Lands Between, from Limgrave to the Consecrated Snowfield.\nMany are often protecting certain areas, or towing around large carriages with treasure in the back. These are always unarmed, and have a large spike through their midsection, which is chained to the carriage itself.\n\nTroll Drops in Elden Ring\n\n 1000 - 7800 Runes\n\nEnemy Type\nItem Drops\nNotes\n\n Common Troll \n\n 1000 - 2268Runes\n\n Common Trolls can be found in Limgrave. They can be found in many above ground places in the Lands Between pulling Carriages. They use a Troll's Golden Sword to fight, but do not drop it. One with a detached chain-and-spike left in it's chest can be found in Liurnia of the Lakes, north of the broken Carriage containing the chest for Treespear, which is on the north end of the broken bridge northeast of Stormveil Castle. There is another with a detached chain-and-spike through it's chest just outside the entrance to Old Altus Tunnel as well as another on the opposite side of the small valley. There is also one in Redmane Castle that jumps in front of the front gate when the player approaches; it has a flaming sword. 64 Poise \n\n Troll Knight \n\n 1320 Runes\nTroll Knight's Sword (8.00% base)\n\n Troll Knights use Sorceries such as the Greatblade Phalanx (a giant version) and can be found in Liurnia of the Lakes; three headless spectral Troll Knights can be found in the middle of the path from the base to the top of the hill The Four Belfries are situated on (these can still drop their sword). A Troll Knight in the flesh can be found in Caria Manor, not far from the fight with Royal Knight LorettaOne blue summoned Troll Knight can be found north of the Liurnia Highway North Site of Grace, down the northwest path. \n\n Frenzied Troll \n\n 2380 - 7800 Runes\nEye of Yelough (30.00% base)\n\n Frenzied Trolls can be found in the Yelough Anix Ruins, although there is one outside the entrance to Volcano Manor. They are unarmed, but can use Frenzied Flame Incantations on a large area in front of them. However, this leaves them wide open for several moments if you are directly underneath, beside or behind one. Fighting them horseback is not advised. \n\n Snow Troll \n\n 3780 - 7800 Runes\nArteria Leaf (30.00% base)\n\nSnow Trolls can be found on Flame Peak fighting Giant Crows and Giant Dogs. They use a Troll's Golden Sword to fight, but do not drop it. They can cast the Flame, Fall Upon Themincantation. There are also four Snow Trolls hauling two Carriages in the Consecrated Snowfield, though these do not drop any Arteria Leaves.\n\nElden Ring Troll Notes & Tips\n\nTrolls have high resistances and deal significant Area-of-Effect damage with their stomps, which can also knock you back. Magic is a safe option for dealing with them, even when their health pools are rather high.\n\nDue to their high health, bleed is quite effective, especially early on when you are dealing low damage per hit.\n\nTrolls are susceptible to Hemorrhage which makes it a good option to whittle their large health pool. Sleep Status is also very easy to apply.\nShooting a troll in the head with a projectile will stun them for a few seconds.\nThere is a Silver Tear that transforms into a Troll at the end of Night's Sacred Ground.\nAfter taking enough damage (around 50% of their health) Trolls will start using their sword (if they have one) which will change their moveset.\nA Frenzied Troll at Mt Gelmir, in front of the entrance of the Volcano Manor, uses frenzied attacks. This variant is also plentiful around the Yelough Anix Ruins.\nThey are capable of destroying the glowing blue statues found across the world. These often contain Smithing Stones and Somber Smithing Stones.\nTrolls found in the Flame Peak use Flame incantations, and are often fighting Giant Crows. If one is having trouble with one or the other, try luring them into fighting each other.\nTheodorix was once a Troll, and a hero of the War against the Giants. He has since become a Magma Wyrm, lurking beyond the frozen river in the Consecrated Snowfield.\nWar Counselor Iji is a Troll who serves under Ranni and Carian royals as a blacksmith and war counselor. He is friendly to you and he offers smithing services.\n\nTroll Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Creatures & Enemies\n\nAbductor Virgin  ♦  Abnormal Stone Cluster  ♦  Albinauric  ♦  Albinauric Wolfback Archer  ♦  Anastasia Tarnished-Eater  ♦  Ancestral Follower  ♦  Ancestral Follower Shaman  ♦  Avionette Soldier  ♦  Azula Beastman  ♦  Baleful Shadow  ♦  Banished Knight  ♦  Basilisk  ♦  Battlemage  ♦  Bear  ♦  Blackflame Monk  ♦  Bloody Finger Nerijus  ♦  Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin  ♦  Boar  ♦  Broken Statue  ♦  Burning Slug  ♦  Celebrant  ♦  Chanting Winged Dame  ♦  Chariot  ♦  Chief Guardian Arghanthy  ♦  Clayman  ♦  Colossal Fingercreeper  ♦  Commoner  ♦  Construct  ♦  Crab  ♦  Crystal Snail  ♦  Crystal Sorcerer  ♦  Deer  ♦  Demi-Human  ♦  Demi-Human Queen  ♦  Depraved Perfumer  ♦  Direwolf  ♦  Dog  ♦  Duelist  ♦  Eagle  ♦  Edgar the Revenger  ♦  Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm  ♦  Exile Soldier  ♦  Fallen Hawks Soldier  ♦  Farum Azula Dragon  ♦  Festering Fingerprint Vyke  ♦  Fingercreeper  ♦  Fire Monk  ♦  Fire Prelate  ♦  Flame Guardian  ♦  Frenzied Villager  ♦  Giant Ant  ♦  Giant Bat  ♦  Giant Crab  ♦  Giant Crayfish  ♦  Giant Dog  ♦  Giant Dragonfly  ♦  Giant Land Octopus  ♦  Giant Land Squirt  ♦  Giant Miranda Sprout  ♦  Giant Rat  ♦  Giant Skeletal Slime  ♦  Giant Skeleton (Spirit)  ♦  Glintstone Dragon  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer  ♦  Godrick Foot Soldier  ♦  Golem  ♦  Great Horned Tragoth  ♦  Great-Jar Warrior  ♦  Guardian  ♦  Guillemot  ♦  Haligtree Foot Soldier  ♦  Haligtree Knight  ♦  Haligtree Soldier  ♦  High Page  ♦  Highwayman  ♦  Inaba, Disciple of Okina  ♦  Inquisitor Ghiza  ♦  Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood  ♦  Kaiden Sellsword  ♦  Knight of Zamor  ♦  Land Octopus  ♦  Land Squirt  ♦  Lazuli Sorcerer  ♦  Lesser Alabaster Lord  ♦  Lesser Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Lesser Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Lesser Burial Watchdog  ♦  Lesser Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Lesser Dragonkin Soldier (Spirit)  ♦  Lesser Fingercreeper  ♦  Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)  ♦  Lesser Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Lesser Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Lesser Omenkiller  ♦  Lesser Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Lesser Runebear  ♦  Lesser Sanguine Noble  ♦  Lesser Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Lesser Wormface  ♦  Leyndell Foot Soldier  ♦  Leyndell Knight  ♦  Leyndell Soldier  ♦  Lion Guardian  ♦  Living Jar  ♦  Lone Wolf  ♦  Mad Tongue Alberich  ♦  Maleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan  ♦  Malformed Star  ♦  Man-Serpent  ♦  Mausoleum Foot Soldier  ♦  Mausoleum Knight  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier  ♦  Miner  ♦  Miranda Sprout  ♦  Misbegotten  ♦  Monstrous Crow  ♦  Mounted Knight  ♦  Nameless White Mask  ♦  Night Maiden  ♦  Noble Sorcerer  ♦  Nomad  ♦  Nox Monk  ♦  Nox Swordstress  ♦  Old Knight Istvan  ♦  Omen  ♦  Oracle Envoy  ♦  Oracle Envoy Giant  ♦  Owl  ♦  Page  ♦  Preceptor Miriam  ♦  Putrid Avatar  ♦  Putrid Corpse  ♦  Radahn Foot Soldier  ♦  Radahn Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Foot Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Knight  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier  ♦  Recusant Henricus  ♦  Redmane Knight  ♦  Revenant  ♦  Rileigh the Idle  ♦  Rotten Duelist  ♦  Scarlet Rot Zombie  ♦  School of Graven Mages  ♦  Serpent Snail  ♦  Servant of Rot  ♦  Sheep  ♦  Silver Tear  ♦  Skeletal Bandit  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman  ♦  Skeletal Slime  ♦  Skeletal Snail  ♦  Skeleton Mage  ♦  Skeletons  ♦  Slug  ♦  Soldier  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish  ♦  Spirit NPC  ♦  Springhare  ♦  Starcaller  ♦  Tanith's Knight  ♦  Teardrop Scarab  ♦  Thorn Sorcerer  ♦  Troll Knight  ♦  Turtle  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer  ♦  Unobtainable Items  ♦  Vargram the Raging Wolf  ♦  Vulgar Militant  ♦  Wandering Nobles  ♦  Warhawk  ♦  Wild Mouflon  ♦  Wraith Caller\n\n
