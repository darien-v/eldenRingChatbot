NPC Invaders). They are programmed to dodge the initial cast as opposed to when the projectiles actually launch. \n\nCannot be charged.\nDeals decent stance breaking damage.\nTracks very well on enemies directly below the player, as the projectiles can travel directly downwards.\nThe projectiles will travel in a light rightwards curve after launching, so the player should account for intervening map geometry.\nGenerally inaccurate for close range as the rocks will shoot past the target. However if the rocks are summoned behind the target because they are so close, the rocks will fling backwards and hit the target.\nInappropriate for tight spaces, as the 3 projectiles are large and will disintegrate on contact with geometry. There is also considerable spread, and effective DPS is significantly reduced if any projectiles do not make contact. On horseback, this can be mitigated by turning perpendicular to the target (causing all 3 projectiles to travel in an approximately straight line towards the target).\nSo long as this spell is cast from the left hand, and a foe is targeted upon casting, both the center and right-most projectile have infinite range. The left-most rock will drop off as normal. \n\nThis was fixed in Patch 1.07\n\nThis is one of a handful of unexpected things whose range is increased from wearing the Arrow's Reach Talisman.\n\nBuilds with Rock Sling \n\nSorcerer Written Guide\n\nMeteor Mage Written Guide\n\nElden Ring Sorceries\n\nAdula's Moonblade  ♦  Ambush Shard  ♦  Briars of Punishment  ♦  Briars of Sin  ♦  Cannon of Haima  ♦  Carian Greatsword  ♦  Carian Phalanx  ♦  Carian Piercer  ♦  Carian Retaliation  ♦  Carian Slicer  ♦  Collapsing Stars  ♦  Comet  ♦  Comet Azur  ♦  Crystal Barrage  ♦  Crystal Burst  ♦  Crystal Release  ♦  Crystal Torrent  ♦  Eternal Darkness  ♦  Explosive Ghostflame  ♦  Fia's Mist  ♦  Founding Rain of Stars  ♦  Freezing Mist  ♦  Frozen Armament  ♦  Gavel of Haima  ♦  Gelmir's Fury  ♦  Glintblade Phalanx  ♦  Glintstone Arc  ♦  Glintstone Cometshard  ♦  Glintstone Icecrag  ♦  Glintstone Pebble  ♦  Glintstone Stars  ♦  Gravity Well  ♦  Great Glintstone Shard  ♦  Great Oracular Bubble  ♦  Greatblade Phalanx  ♦  Loretta's Greatbow  ♦  Loretta's Mastery  ♦  Lucidity  ♦  Magic Downpour  ♦  Magic Glintblade  ♦  Magma Shot  ♦  Meteorite  ♦  Meteorite of Astel  ♦  Night Comet  ♦  Night Maiden's Mist  ♦  Night Shard  ♦  Oracle Bubbles  ♦  Rancorcall  ♦  Ranni's Dark Moon  ♦  Rennala's Full Moon  ♦  Rock Blaster  ♦  Roiling Magma  ♦  Rykard's Rancor  ♦  Scholar's Armament  ♦  Scholar's Shield  ♦  Shard Spiral  ♦  Shatter Earth  ♦  Shattering Crystal  ♦  Star Shower  ♦  Starlight  ♦  Stars of Ruin  ♦  Swift Glintstone Shard  ♦  Terra Magica  ♦  Thop's Barrier  ♦  Thops's Barrier (Spell)  ♦  Tibia's Summons  ♦  Unseen Blade  ♦  Unseen Form  ♦  Zamor Ice Storm (Spell)\n\n

QUESTION
How can Rock Sling be effectively used in combat scenarios?

ANSWER
Rock Sling can be effectively used in combat scenarios by taking advantage of its delayed projectiles to target enemies that dodge spells, aiming accurately due to the rightwards curve of the projectiles, avoiding tight spaces, and utilizing certain strategies like casting from the left hand to extend the range of two projectiles.
