CONTEXT
\n\n Renna \n\nLocation\nLimgrave\n\nRole\nThe Storyteller\n\nVoiced by\n Aimee-Ffion Edwards \n\nRenna is an NPC in Elden Ring. Renna is a blue humanoid character that has four arms and two faces. Renna will give you the ability to summon spirits at a specific point in the game. These spirits come in different forms, including magic, Skeletons, Wolves, and many more. Renna will leave after teaching you how to summon spirits.\n\nUnless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?"\n\nRenna Location in Elden Ring\nRenna can be found in the following location(s):\n\nFound sitting by the ruins of the Church of Elleh in Limgrave. Return to the Church of Elleh via teleporting on the map menu, after acquiring the ability to summon your Spectral Steed from Melina to find her. [Map Link] \n\nManually going back to the Church (via walking there) won't make Renna appear. Sitting at a Site of  Grace (any) will not work either.\nPassing the time (done while resting at a Site of Grace), either inside or outside the church, will not make her appear.\nQuitting out of the game and loading back in will not make her appear, regardless of time of the day.\nTime of the day doesn't matter for making her appear. Once the player teleports to the Church of Elleh after acquiring the Spectral Steed Whistle, the time will automatically be set to night.\n\nAfter talking to her and opting to tell her that you can summon Torrent, the Spectral Steed, she will gift the player with the Spirit Calling Bell key item, and the Lone Wolf Ashes.\nFound again in Ranni's Rise. Here she begins a long and important quest relevant to much of the game's story.\nIf Melina appears to offer the player access to the Roundtable Hold, Ranni will no longer spawn at the Church even if you press cancel and don't actually go. You can still start her quest line at Ranni's Rise. \n\nIf you do not get the Spirit Calling Bell from Renna, you can buy the bell and the Lone Wolf Ashes from the Twin Maiden Husks in the Roundtable Hold.\n\nRenna Questline: How to complete Renna's Quest\nSee Ranni the Witch.\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Renna\nIntroduction\n\nThis way, Tarnished. May I have a word.\nA pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished. I am the witch Renna.I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.And upon looking into the matter, the talk, I surmise, is of thee.Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.\n\nIf you say you can call Torrent\n\nAh. As I had hoped. I was entrusted this, for thee. By Torrent's former master.Tis a bell for calling forth spirits. Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.\n\nBefore disappearing\n\n Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished. I doubt we shall meet again. But all the same, learn well thee Lands Between. How long will it be, I wonder...Before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers?\n\nAt Ranni's Rise\n\nOh, again we cross paths. I believe I said my name was Renna, when we last met. It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty...But Tarnished, what business hast thou here? I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.\n\nNo Particular Reason\n\nNo reason in particular, thou claimest? Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion. Wilt thou enter into my service? I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path. That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before. Well? Has that roused thy interest?\n\nServe Ranni the Witch\n\nI see. A choice well made. Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer. But I require as much of those under my command. I anticipate good work from thee. Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.\nThere is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd. I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City. I have called Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars. Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also. Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst. I am sure the others will be doing just the same.\nSpeak with the three who await thee below. Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise they worth. It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all. \n\nAfter Speaking to the Three\n\nAh, allow me to forewarn thee. I shall soon enter my slumber. And it will be some time before I wake. This doll's body is not without its hindrances...Still, I have high hopes for thee. I look forward to the good news when I arise. \n\nVisit\n\nVisit dialogue goes here.\n\nRecommendation\n\nRecommendations go here.\n\nSmall Talk\n\nSmall talk goes here.\n\nOther\n\nElden Ring Renna Notes & Trivia\n\nThe "Trivia" section on the IMDB page for Elden Ring claims that "Game of Thrones" actress Maisie Williams lends her voice to Renna character in the game's story trailer. However, there are no reliable sources that support this other than people claiming to recognise her voice in various online forums.\nRenna appears to have a spectral mirror image of herself attached to her at the right eye.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
