He can also be seen as a herald, making proclamations about the Radahn Festival around Redmane Castle just as the festival is getting prepared to start. He then, initiates the festival.

This includes the Eccentric's Hood, Eccentric's Armor, Eccentric's Manchettes, and Eccentric's Breeches. You can also gain the Glintstone Kris from Sellen as a reward and gain access to Shard Spiral for purchase.\n\nSiding with Jerren\nChoose to side with Jerren and you will obtain Sellen's Bell Bearing, and Witch's Glintstone Crown upon the defeat of Sellen. He will also reward you with an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone after speaking with him. You will find him where his summon sign was outside the Grand Library Site of Grace. \n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Witch-Hunter Jerren\nIntroduction before the festival§\n\nOh, Tarnished, are you? How did you slip inside, with the gate closed? Hmph. No matter. If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book. I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate. A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn, the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune.\n[I'm not the festive type] Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum? No matter. One day you will see. That true warriors bask in glory at the festival. \n[About Iji] Well, I haven't heard that name in an age. Then you must serve Princess Ranni? The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this: The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate into motion. By the by... Is that old fool still hammering out weapons? His enormous frame, cramped in that little place... Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him. And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone. But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot...\nGo on, now. This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.\n\n§After the festival\n\nAt last, the war festival has ended. Brave champion you have our gratitude. The Celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased. Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honorable death. \n\nFinally, my work is done. I am no longer bound to this fortress. I have a task in mind. Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand. May we meet again if the fates deign it, brave champion. \n\nFestival Proclamation\n\nChampions, welcome! The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh! General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you! A celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!\nAre you good and prepared, young chum? The festival begins!\n\nSmall Talk (Witchbane Ruins)\n\nAh, well met. I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places. You didn't ... know Sellen did you? Well, whatever the case, she's dead now. Just put it behind you. She was known as the graven witch Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hands. The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy\nIt is strange through. The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled. I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere. I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body. A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me. \n\nSiding with Jerren, during Sorceress Sellen invasion\n\n"Sellen, Graven Witch, enemy of Caria.I vow this time to crush both your frame and your primal glintstone.I am Jerren, bringer of your death. Do not forget."\n\nFinal\n\nMy thanks, for the aid given. I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion. But I  didn't know he was talking about you. You've helped me fulfil an old promise. This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it. [Hands you x1 Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone]\nWell, I must be leaving now. Brave warrior, if the fates deign it.. No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney.\nWell, I must be leaving now. If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished.\n\nWhen attacked\n\nUgh! What's the matter with you? You trying to get revenge?\n(Combat) Very well. If the Graven Witch put you under her spell, you must be eliminated...\n(On player kill) Rest now. Alongside the witch's corpse.\n(On death) You...are a menace... Iji...beware...\n\nElden Ring Witch-Hunter Jerren Notes & Trivia\n\nCan be summoned during the second phase of Radahn's boss fight\nIn combat, Jerren wields a Flamberge with the Flaming Strike Ash of War, and a Carian Glintblade Staff, which he uses to cast Magic Glintblade.\nThis set's design is inspired directly from the armor once worn by German Landsknecht, elite mercenaries who were often hired and served underneath the Holy Roman Empire. They were especially famous for their use of the Zweihander greatsword.\nHis set is very similar in appearance to Slave Knight Gael, along with the hood and beard. \n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit\n\n
