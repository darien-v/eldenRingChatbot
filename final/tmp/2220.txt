CONTEXT
\n\n Arcane \n\nType\nMain Attribute\n\nEffects\nAttribute governing Discovery.Also affects Holy Defense, Vitality, and certain Sorceries and Incantations.\n\nArcane is one of the Stats in Elden Ring. Stats refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. Arcane primarily influences the Discovery stat, increasing the chance to find items when defeating enemies. Arcane is also used as a modifier for weapons that scale with the Arcane stat, improving the effectiveness and damage of certain Spells. It is one of the 8 Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on to level up, increasing the Stat's effectiveness and influencing their relative secondary stats. Stats such as Arcane are an important aspect of character progression in Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring Arcane Stat General Information\n\nArcane is your primary way of increasing your Discovery stat. The higher your character's Discovery the higher the chance items will drop from enemies, including making rare drops less rare. \n\nEvery character has a base of 100 Discovery\nFlat rate of +1 Discovery per Arcane level\n\nArcane primarily increases your Holy Defense, which increases your defense against attacks that deal Holy Damage. \n\n+2 Holy Defense per level from 1 to 20 Arcane\n+0.66 Holy Defense per level from 21 to 35 Arcane\n+0.4 Holy Defense per level from 36 to 60 Arcane\n+0.25 Holy Defense per level from 61 to 99 Arcane\n\nArcane also primarily increases your Vitality, which increases your resistance to Death Blight. \n\n+1 Vitality per level from 1 to 15 Arcane\n+0.6 Vitality per level from 16 to 40 Arcane\n+0.5 Vitality per level from 41 to 60 Arcane\n+0.25 Vitality per level from 61 to 99 Arcane\n\nArcane affects any Arrow status buildup if the Bow scales with Arcane, which currently only includes the Serpent Bow.\nFor weapons that have Arcane scaling, Arcane scales up the amount of Blood Loss build-up, Poison build-up, Sleep build-up, and Madness build-up on the weapon. \n\nArcane scaling can be added to weapons using a Blood, Poison, or Occult Enhancement. The Black Whetblade facilitates use of these enhancements.\n\nSome Weapons require a certain amount of levels in Arcane to be able to wield them effectively.\nWhen scaling the attack power of a melee armament, like all stats, Arcane soft caps differ depending on the weapon and the damage type being scaled. Scaling on physical damage may be 18/60/80 or 20/60/80. Scaling on magic, fire, lightning, or holy damage is always 20/50/80.\nWhen scaling the status effect build-up of a melee armament or a spell that has Arcane scaling, Arcane soft caps are 25/45/60. Note that for spells, the catalyst must have Arcane scaling and the amount of increase in build-up is significantly smaller than melee armaments. \n\nTo give an example, a +10 Reduvia at 45 arcane has 87 bleed build up; at 60, it has 94 build up.\n\nWhen scaling the status effect build-up of throwing weapons, such as pots, Arcane a unique scaling curve formula for this with soft caps at 15/30/50.\nWhen scaling the status effect build-up of poison on arrows used with the Serpent Bow, Arcane has a unique scaling curve formula for this with soft caps at 15/30/50. However, for scaling the status effect build-up of blood or sleep arrows used with the Serpent Bow, Arcane scales the same as melee armaments, with soft caps at 25/45/60.\nWhen scaling the sorcery scaling of the Albinauric Staff or the incantation scaling of the Dragon Communion Seal, Arcane soft caps are 15/30/45.\n\nList of Weapons that scale with Arcane\nAll weapons listed are shown as if they were level 1.\n\nWeapon\nWeapon Type\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nCrit\nStr\nDex\nInt\nFai\nArc\nWeight\nPassive Effects\nPhy\nMag\nFir\nLit\nHol\nBst\n\n Ripple Blade  \nAxe\n70\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n11-\n11-\n--\n--\n20A\n4.5 \n-\n47\n31\n31\n31\n31\n31\n\n  Serpent Bow \nBow\n75\n-\n-\n-\n-\n100\n8E\n15D\n--\n--\n11D\n3.5 \n Causes Poison buildup with all arrow types.
