The Coded Sword scales exclusively with Faith and is a potent Weapon for dealing Holy damage. Updated to Patch 1.08.\n\nHidden sword once granted to the Tarnished of the Roundtableby the Two Fingers. A formless cipher comprises its blade, whichdeals holy damage no shield can repel. Champions would gatherat the Roundtable Hold in days long past, when the Two Fingerswere masters of oration, their flesh yet full of vigor.\n\nWhere to Find Coded Sword in Elden Ring\nThe Coded Sword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nFound in upstairs throne room of Fortified Manor, Leyndell Royal Capital. From Fortified Manor, 1st Floor site of grace, head outside the building, turn right, climb the stable roofs to the right and re-enter the second floor of the Fortified Manor. Head towards the Round Table room, and the Coded Sword is on the throne of the Throne Room southwest of the Round Table. [Elden Ring Map Link] Video Location\n\nThis weapon must be acquired before defeating Maliketh, the Black Blade, as it is not accessible in Leyndell, Ashen Capital.\n\nElden Ring Coded Sword Notes & Tips\n\nWeapon Skill: Unblockable Blade.\nCannot be infused with Ashes of War\nCannot be enchanted with Magic nor boosted with Consumables.\nThe Coded Sword is resilient to "weapon bounce" commonly experienced by other small armaments when attacking into shields, or certain enemies (eg. Miners). This allows the weapon to excel with one-handed use in situations where other armaments would demand a two-handed approach. The ability to attack uninterrupted into an enemy's block plays into the weapon's overall "unblockable" theme, with its unblockable weapon skill, and pure Holy damage.\nDue to its damage being purely Holy, the Coded Sword benefits greatly from the Sacred Scorpion Charm.\nSell Value:   1000.\nThe sword's shape, appearance, and purely Holy damage, as well as the effect that it "turns off" when sheathed, might be a reference to the Sunblade, a magical weapon from the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG.\nNote: As of Patch 1.07, FP consumption has been reduced from 25 to 18.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08, Straight Swords poise damage has been reduced only on PVP.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below. Additionally, the running attack speed, first attack speed and speed of guard counter of straight sword has increased. The attack recovery time has also decreased.\nOther notes and player tips go here\n\nMoveset & Videos in Elden Ring for Coded Sword\n\nGolden Sword Sage Written Guide\n\nStraight Swords Showcase\n\nCoded Sword PvP Poise Damage in Elden Ring\nPatch 1.10 adjusted PVP Poise Damage of all Weapons including some Spells and Incantations.
