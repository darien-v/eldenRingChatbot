QUESTION
Why is it important to use both Cerulean Crystal Tears in the Flask of Wondrous Physick to fully restore your FP in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Using both Cerulean Crystal Tears in the Flask of Wondrous Physick fully restores your FP because the resulting concoction restores half of one's maximum FP, and using both crystal tears doubles this effect in Elden Ring.
