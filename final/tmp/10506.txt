The Jar Cannon does not scale with any stats, and is a good Weapon for a ranged combat option. This weapon deals high damage, but users must be tactful with positioning and aim due to its slow reload speed.  \n\nJar cannon which uses explosives to fire greatbolts. Deals great damage but is slow to reload. \nExperimental firearm brought to the assault on Volcano Manor, where it was discovered that no one knew how to use it.\n\nWhere to Find Jar Cannon in Elden Ring\nThe Jar Cannon weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nDropped by the boss Demi-Human Queen Margot at the end of Volcano Cave north of Mt. Gelmir.

This also means you effectively only need 23 Strength and 12 Dexterity to fire it.\nSell Value:   500\nThe Jar Cannon's projectile attack benefits from the +10% damage of the Arrow's Sting Talisman, the +10% damage of the Ritual Sword Talisman, and the range bonus of the Arrow's Reach Talisman. It can also be increased by the Lord of Blood's Exultation and the White Mask, which can be easily activated using Seppuku.\nGolden Vow and Flame Grant Me Strength also increase the damage of bolts, with the latter enhancing Explosive Bolts more as they include fire damage.\nThe Jar Cannon projectile attack does not count as a charge attack, therefore the Spiked Cracked Tear and Axe Talisman do not benefit it in any way. \nYou can skip the long post-firing animation by using the recoil to push you backward off a ledge. If your character falls at least from a waist-high drop, the entire post-firing animation is skipped, allowing you to reload and fire immediately. If done optimally, you can fire twice in the same time it takes to fire once normally.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed. Please refer to the Upgrades Table of this weapon below.\nLike most ranged weapons, leveling Dexterity can marginally improve the draw speed & projectile velocity of the Jar Cannon. \nOther notes and player tips go here\n\nBest Jar Cannon Buffs\nUse these Buffs to maximize the performance of the Jar Cannon weapon.

QUESTION
How can a player optimize the performance of the Jar Cannon weapon in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
To optimize the performance of the Jar Cannon weapon in Elden Ring, a player should use buffs like Arrow's Sting Talisman for +10% attack power, Arrow's Reach Talisman for increased range, Flame Grant Me Strength for +20% attack power, Lord of Blood's Exultation for +20% attack power, and White Mask for +10% attack power, and also employ the recoil mechanic to skip the post-firing animation.
