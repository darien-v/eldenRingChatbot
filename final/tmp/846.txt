Onyx Lords are a tall ancient race of humanoids with mastery over gravity magic that share a common background and appearance with the Alabaster Lords. This is an optional boss as players don't have to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring.\nLesser Alabaster Lord is the normal enemy form of this boss.\n\n A race of ancients with skin of stone who were said to have risen to life when a meteor struck long ago. They were called lords in reverential fear of their destructive power.\n\nElden Ring Onyx Lord Location\n\nRoyal Grave Evergaol [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nSealed Tunnel [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nOnyx Lord Combat information\n\nStance: 65\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken\nDamage: Slash, Strike, Pierce, Magic\n Gravity type\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 20\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 20\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nElden Ring Onyx Lord Boss Guide\n\nOnyx Lord Boss Video Guide\n\nCurrently located on the Alabaster Lord page. The Royal Grave Evergaol boss was named Alabaster Lord in a previous patch.\n\nOnyx Lord Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Onyx Lord:\n\nFight him on the outer edges of the arena.\nTake advantage of his Meteorite's long cast animation.\n\nMelee Users\nOnyx Lord only has a few moves in his repertoire and it is relatively easy to discern his patterns. Consider fighting him on the outer edges of the arena as the center has uneven terrain which can cause his meteorites to impact with the ground near you, dealing splash damage.\nOnyx Lord has three main attack patterns: Meteorite, Slice and Dice, and Gravity Well. He will rarely diverge from these attacks. Meteorite has a very long animation and should be exploited. After he plunges his sword from the ground, you can try and get behind him for one or two hits. The meteors don't track very well at melee range and they are unlikely to hit you this way. His Gravity Orb attack comes out very quickly, has very good tracking and requires precise timing to dodge. His Slice and Dice move begins with a diagonal dash to his left as he slashes upwards followed by a large, sweeping slash in the opposite direction. Dodging through the first slash towards his right side should prevent the second slash from hitting you and will position you behind him for a quick counter. \nOverall, his Meteorite and Slice and Dice moves are his most punishable for melee players.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nRanged players have the added advantage of being completely out of range of his sword plunge into Meteorite summon. Do note that he will sometimes charge towards you before he performs the plunge but the AoE is easy enough to avoid. The meteorites themselves have a slow travel speed and ranged/magic users should take this time to get a few hits in while they get ready to sidestep the projectiles. If you maintain your distance, the first slash of his Slice and Dice attack should land nowhere near you. However, this also makes you an easier target for the second slash. Try to dodge diagonally to the right after you see the first slash and then punish his recovery time accordingly.\n\nOnyx Lord Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nMeteorite\nPlunges his sword into the ground, sending a shockwave out in a small radius around him. A black hole then forms above him where several meteorites emerge and fly towards his target. These projectiles explode on impact and leave a burning effect on the ground for a few seconds. The lower his HP is, the more meteorites he unleashes at once.\nDodge the plunge attack precisely and get behind him. Alternatively, maintain your distance and sidestep the incoming meteorites.\n\nGravity Well\nOnyx Lord forms an orb of void in his left hand and fires it at its target, pulling them closer if it hits. May also use this as a close ranged melee swipe, which will instead knock those away if it hits.\n This move has very good tracking and requires precision timing to dodge. Dodge to the side or through the orb. The melee variant comes out very quickly, so dodge accordingly. \n\nSlice and Dice\nOnyx Lord dashes diagonally to his left as he slashes upward with his sword. He quickly follows up with a downward slash in the other direction as he changes direction himself.\nDodge through the first slash towards his right shoulder to get behind him and counter as he misses the second slash. For ranged, watch out for the first slash and then anticipate the second slash and dodge diagonally forward and to the right.\n\nOnyx Lord Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThe Onyx Lord in Royal Grave Evergaol was originally called "Alabaster Lord". The flavor text of Meteorite was also updated to reflect the change. The main difference between the two is their weaponry. Alabaster Lords wield greatswords, while Onyx Lords use curved greatswords.\n\n Onyx Lord  Royal Grave Evergaol  \n\n__image__\n\nDrops\n3,600Meteorite\n\nHP\n4,058\n\nElden Ring Onyx Lord Boss (Royal Grave Evergaol)\n\nThis is an optional boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Behind Caria Manor\nMultiplayer is not allowed for this boss\nYou cannot summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nOnyx Lord Location\nImprisoned in the Royal Grave Evergaol in northwestern Liurnia of the Lakes.

QUESTION
Why do players consider the Meteorite and Slice and Dice moves of the Onyx Lord as the most punishable for melee players?

ANSWER
The Meteorite and Slice and Dice moves of the Onyx Lord are considered the most punishable for melee players because the Meteorite has a long animation allowing for safe hits, and the Slice and Dice move can be easily countered by dodging through the first slash and positioning for a counterattack behind the boss.
