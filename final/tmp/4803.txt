Map Link\n\nElden Ring Lhutel the Headless Guide\n\nGhost Glovewort is required to upgrade Lhutel the Headless.\nLhutel will periodically teleport while in combat, allowing her to move around quickly, avoid being surrounded by enemies, and avoid large area of effect attacks from enemies.\nStrikes from her lance cause buildup of the death blight status on her target. However, the vast majority of enemies found in Elden Ring are immune to death blight. Also, one of the main enemy types not immune to death blight, that being NPC invaders, tend to only appear in areas where the player is not able to summon her or any other spirits via spirit ashes. (Note, as of 1.08 this may prove a bit more viable within the Caelid Coliseum wherein you can summon Lhutel or other Spirit Ashes to do battle versus other players.)\nHer heavy armor, greatshield, teleportation ability, mix of melee and ranged attacks, and immunity against all status effects (an ability shared with all other spirit ash spirits) allow her to work well alongside a variety of player builds as a "tank" or damage dealer. It should be noted that due to her slow attack frequency and teleporting around that she holds aggro very poorly.\n\nElden Ring Spirits\n\nAlbinauric Ashes  ♦  Ancestral Follower Ashes  ♦  Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff Ashes  ♦  Archer Ashes  ♦  Avionette Soldier Ashes  ♦  Azula Beastman Ashes  ♦  Banished Knight Engvall Ashes  ♦  Banished Knight Oleg Ashes  ♦  Battlemage Hugues Ashes  ♦  Blackflame Monk Amon Ashes  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Floh  ♦  Clayman Ashes  ♦  Cleanrot Knight Finlay Ashes  ♦  Crystalian Ashes  ♦  Demi-Human Ashes  ♦  Depraved Perfumer Carmaan Ashes  ♦  Dolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet  ♦  Dung Eater Puppet  ♦  Fanged Imp Ashes  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina Puppet  ♦  Fire Monk Ashes  ♦  Giant Rat Ashes  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Godrick Soldier Ashes  ♦  Greatshield Soldier Ashes  ♦  Haligtree Soldier Ashes  ♦  Jarwight Puppet  ♦  Kindred of Rot Ashes  ♦  Land Squirt Ashes  ♦  Latenna The Albinauric  ♦  Leyndell Soldier Ashes  ♦  Lone Wolf Ashes  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head Ashes  ♦  Man-Serpent Ashes  ♦  Marionette Soldier Ashes  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier Ashes  ♦  Mimic Tear Ashes  ♦  Miranda Sprout Ashes  ♦  Nepheli Loux Puppet  ♦  Nightmaiden & Swordstress Puppets  ♦  Noble Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Nomad Ashes  ♦  Omenkiller Rollo  ♦  Oracle Envoy Ashes  ♦  Page Ashes  ♦  Perfumer Tricia Ashes  ♦  Putrid Corpse Ashes  ♦  Radahn Soldier Ashes  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier Ashes  ♦  Redmane Knight Ogha Ashes  ♦  Rotten Stray Ashes  ♦  Skeletal Bandit Ashes  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman Ashes  ♦  Soldjars of Fortune Ashes  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish Ashes  ♦  Stormhawk Deenh  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer Ashes  ♦  Vulgar Militia Ashes  ♦  Wandering Noble Ashes  ♦  Warhawk Ashes  ♦  Winged Misbegotten Ashes\n\n
