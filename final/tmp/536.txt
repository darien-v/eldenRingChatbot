CONTEXT
\n\n Effigy of the Martyr \n\nEnables the ability to join summoningpools in the sub-area using theSmall Golden Effigy\n\nEffigies of the Martyr (also called "Summoning Pools") are statues usually found in sub-areas to make it easier to place and find summon signs for cooperative or competitive multiplayer. When you use the Small Golden Effigy (cooperative) or Small Red Effigy (competitive), your summon sign will automatically be placed at all Effigies of the Martyr you've activated within the current region or legacy dungeon. They are typically found near Sites of Grace, especially graces at the start of mini-dungeons and legacy dungeons, as well as near notable area boss encounters.\nEffigies of the Martyr allow players looking for multiplayer to be summoned more often and in a wider variety of locations. Since the Small Effigy items can be activated anywhere, they also allow players more freedom in single-player adventuring without having to return to a specific location to re-place their summon sign after each summon. However, crossing region boundaries or entering boss rooms will still cancel Effigy summon signs.\nOther useful statues found throughout the Lands Between include Stakes of Marika and Rebirth Monuments.\nNote: There's currently no way to disable an Effigy of the Martyr once it's enabled, so choose which you enable wisely. If there's a particular dungeon you don't care for, don't activate its Effigy! If you only want to help out with the boss of a legacy dungeon, only activate the Effigy nearest to that boss (or just place a single summon sign with Tarnished's Furled Finger).\n\nAll Effigy of the Martyr Locations\nThe exact boundaries of each zone within a given region are listed where they're known, but some require additional research to determine their exact extents.\nLimgrave\nOverworld\nIn the northwest, this zone ends at the point where the Limgrave map ends and the Liurnia map begins and at the entrance to Margit's boss room in Stormveil Castle.

QUESTION
Why does disabling an Effigy of the Martyr once it's enabled seem to be currently not possible?

ANSWER
Disabling an Effigy of the Martyr once it's enabled seems currently not possible because there is no current mechanism provided to deactivate an Effigy after it has been activated.
