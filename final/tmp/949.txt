If you need to heal or use items, give yourself plenty of space.\n\nMelee Users\nGodfrey attacks very agressively and sporadically, often combining slow and fast attacks in a lengthy combo. Attacking after a slow attack in his combo and dodging through the fast attacks will allow you to whittle down his health. As for the weapons, you can either use a heavy, colossal, or any fast weapons. Avoid using weapons that deals holy damage, try for ones that has pierce or lightning damage. If you're using a heavy or colossal weapon, don't go for a combo, no matter what type of attack he throws at you. He will most likely switch up his attacks from slow to fast and fast to slow swings. If you're using a fast weapon, you can maybe manage to get at least two to three hits after a slow attack, just don't get too greedy.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor magic and ranged users, heavy-hitting spells/incantations and skill are the key if you don't really wanna use any melee. The same strategy above applies here, you have to be wary that this boss can combine slow and fast hitting attacks in a single string. His range options are limited but he can rush you down if you're not careful. Equipping talismans, runes, or armor that can help in reducing the cast time of spells is useful for this fight if you're a magic user.\n For Dexterity users, a very viable option is to obtain Bolt of Gransax, upgrade it to +5 and pair with Godfrey's Icon/Carian Filigreed Crest/Lightning Scorpion Charm. Godfrey is not an aggresive boss, what can be used to use charged Ancient Lightning Spear skill for massive damage.\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade) Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nGround Stomp\nRaises its foot high and slams it downward, sending out a stream of rocks forward in a cone-shaped formation.\nYou can dodge roll to either side, but it is recommended that you just block the attack, since mistiming the dodge can clip you. If you can gauge that you're in a safe distance to dodge roll, you can dodge roll backwards. This attack can also be jumped over.\n\nTwo-handed Axe Slam\nTwo-hands the weapon then slams it to the ground, following up with a series of axe swings.\nThis is the fastest move of the boss. You'll see him lift up the axe with two hands, and slams the weapon onto the ground, this can be followed-up with his other combos. It's best to just dodge roll away for this.\n\nJumping Axe Throw\nLeaps into the air, throws his axe towards the player, then dives onto it.\nIf you see him jump to the air from a distance, just continue running towards him and go under, you will completely avoid the attack this way.\n\nJumping Axe Slam\nJumps into the air, with a bit of delay, slams the axe to the ground.\nYou can roll backwards for this attack.\n\nOne-handed Overhead Slam\nPuts the axe back on his left arm, then swings it overhead before slamming it onto the ground.\nDodge roll to either side at the right time.\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade) Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: Edward Rowe\nThe axe that it uses is not broken, which shows that the original axe had two blades.\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade) Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
