CONTEXT
\nSmithing Stones are Upgrade Materials in Elden Ring. Smithing Stones are used to upgrade regular Weapons and Shields. This page covers a full list of all the Smithing Stones in Elden Ring which includes information regarding description, location, and usage.\nYou can visit the Upgrades page to learn more about the Upgrade Mechanics of Elden Ring.\n\nHow to use Smithing Stones\nSmithing Stones can be used to upgrade regular equipment up to +25 (For unique equipment please visit Somber Smithing Stones). You'll need to visit a Blacksmith and have the correct level of Smithing Stone in correlation to the current level of your weapon.\nTotal upgrade costs\nFor normal upgrades 2, 4 and 6 amounts of Smithing Stones are required. This gives a total of 12 Smithing Stones of each level. As of Patch 1.03, upgrade prices have been reduced to roughly 1/4 across the board. (e.g Smithing Stone (1) costs 200 runes instead of 800, Smithing Stone (2) costs 400 runes instead of 1,600, etc.)\nTotal Number Needed\nThere are 182 Weapons and 58 Shields that require Smithing Stones to upgrade. You would need 2,880 of each numbered stone and 240 Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones to upgrade everything. Due to the limited number of Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones, this would require you to reach NG+ 18 (19 playthroughs).\n\nWhere can I find Smithing Stones?\nSmithing Stones can be acquired through exploration, you can visit our Interactive Map and filter by "Upgrade Material" for a complete list. You can also visit the individual Smithing Stone pages listed in the table below for a complete list of locations.\nEarly Game Smithing Stone Farming\nYou can purchase Smithing Stone (1) and Smithing Stone (2) from Nomadic Merchants in Limgrave and Weeping Peninsula, and the Isolated Merchant in Weeping Peninsula. You can also defeat Troll enemies to get them as drops.\n\nHow to get a max level weapon as early as possible in Elden Ring\nThe best place to find regular Smithing Stones in bulk are in tunnels around the world. Once you’ve opened a map to a new place, you can find new tunnels by looking for a small black semi-circles surrounded by a faint orange outline on the map. It isn't possible to get a +24 weapon without clearing some dungeons (namely Leyndell), but you can get at least up to a +15 right at the beginning of the game just through exploration and avoiding enemies.\nStarting from Limgrave, head up north to Stormhill and go to the cliffside southeast of the Warmaster’s Shack where a bunch of Trolls are hanging out. Make one destroy the stone statue in the area to get 5 Smithing Stone (1) and a Smithing Stone (2). Next head south to the Limgrave Tunnels to find 8 more Smithing Stone (1). In tunnels, Smithing Stones can be found on the walls or floors where enemy miners are currently mining, as yellow crystals on the ground, or on corpses lying around.\nExit the tunnel and follow the road going up north to Stormhill. When you get to the end of the collapsed bridge, jump down to the cliffside on the left and follow the path up to Liurnia of the Lakes. Head northwest to find 3 Smithing Stone (2) in a gazebo southwest of the Temple Quarter. In the southwestern part of the Academy Gate Town, you’ll find another 3 Smithing Stone (2) on a corpse near a Giant Crab. Head southeast to find a gazebo with 3 Smithing Stone (3) in it and slightly further north is a corpse on a chair with another 3 Smithing Stone (3). Make your way up north to the Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel to collect the rest of your Smithing Stone (2) and (3). You can find 5 Smithing Stone (2) and 8 Smithing Stone (3) there. You can also obtain the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (1) by defeating the boss here to buy unlimited Smithing Stone (1) and (2) at the Twin Maiden Husk if you wish.\nHead up north to the Ruin-Strewn Precipice to find 9 Smithing Stone (4) and 2 Smithing Stone (5). Teleport back to Limgrave and take the teleporter chest at the Dragon-Burnt Ruins to get to the Sellia Crystal Tunnel. There, you will find 8 Smithing Stone (5). Head west and enter the Gael Tunnel to find 8 more Smithing Stone (4). You’ll have to interact with the Site of Grace near the end to leave. You can find the last 2 Smithing Stone (5) at Redmane Castle.\nUpgrading your weapon past +15 will require you to progress in the game. Finding higher level Smithing Stones in tunnels is harder and you may have to rely on the unlimited stock you get from finding their respective Bell Bearing. You can obtain the two halves of the medallion for the Grand Lift of Dectus without fighting to take you to Altus Plateau. The Sealed Tunnel houses 3 Smithing Stone (6) and the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (2) for an unlimited stock of Smithing Stone (3) & (4). You'll find the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (3) at Zamor Ruins in the Mountaintops of the Giants for unlimited Smithing Stone (5) & (6). The Yelough Anix Tunnel in Consecrated Snowfield has 8 Smithing Stone (8) and you can obtain the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (4) for unlimited Smithing Stone (7) & (8) by defeating the Godskin Duo at Crumbling Farum Azula.\nThe earliest Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone you can acquire is from helping Jerren at the end of Sellen's questline. You'll have to progress far enough to defeat Rennala at the Academy of Raya Lucaria and Radahn during the festival at Redmane Castle to be able to finish this quest and obtain the stone.\nSMITHING STONES TABLE FOR ELDEN RING\n\nQuick Search of All Smithing Stones\n\n Normal\nUpgrade material\nBell Bearing\nUnit costs in runes\nTotal costs in runes\nCumulative costs in runes\n\nTo +3\n Smithing Stone (1) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (1)\n200\n2,400 \n2,400\n\nTo +6\n Smithing Stone (2) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (1) \n400\n4,800\n7,200\n\nTo +9\n Smithing Stone (3) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (2) \n600\n7,200\n14,400\n\nTo +12\n Smithing Stone (4) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (2)\n900\n10,800\n25,200\n\nTo +15\n  Smithing Stone (5) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (3)\n1,200\n14,400\n39,600\n\nTo +18\n  Smithing Stone (6) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (3)\n1,500\n18,000\n57,600\n\nTo +21\n Smithing Stone (7) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (4)\n2,400\n28,800\n86,400\n\nTo +24\n Smithing Stone (8) \nSmithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (4)\n3,600\n43,200\n129,600\n\nTo +25\n Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone \nN/A \n-\n -\n129,600\n\n
