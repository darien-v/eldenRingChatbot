Falling beyond certain distances in Elden Ring can result in the player losing health or dying. The damage taken is a percentage of the player's maximum HP, so leveling up Vigor does nothing to make falls more survivable.\nThe table shows the various breakpoints at which Fall Damage occurs, though there are a few items and modifiers than can negate, diminish, or increase the damage taken.\n\nDexterity and Fall Damage\nLeveling up Dexterity can reduce Fall Damage.\n\nDexterity begins reducing fall damage at 21 and above, though the overall effect is minor.\nFall Damage is reduced all the way to 99 dexterity, where the damage reduction maxes out at 20% (e.g. a ~19.9m fall now reduces 40% HP instead of 50%).\n\nDexterity\nDamage Multiplier\n\n20 or less\n1.0x Damage\n\n35\n0.9x Damage\n\n99\n0.8x Damage\n\nEquip Load and Fall Damage\nYour Equip Load can increase Fall Damage.\n\nLight and Medium Load have no effect on fall damage.\nWith a Heavy Load, characters start experiencing minor increases to Fall Damage, at a little over 70% Equip Load, reaching a 10% increase at 100% (e.g. a ~19.9m fall now reduces 55% HP instead of 50%).\nOverloaded characters experience further increases to Fall Damage, capping at a 30% increase at 150% Equip Load (e.g. a ~19.9m fall now reduces 65% HP instead of 50%).\n\nFall Damage Negation\nThe following items and spells can negate Fall Damage. However, they do no alter the threshold height at which lethal damage is taken.\n\nAssassin's Approach\nLongtail Cat Talisman\nSoft Cotton\n\nWhile riding Torrent, Spiritsprings will negate fall damage if the player lands near the base of one.\n\nInvulnerability Negates Fall Damage\nIf the player can enter an invulnerable state during their fall, such as when initiating a Critical Attack, they can negate the associated Fall Damage (including lethal falls).\nIt is possible to initiate a critical attack at a ledge, suspending the player and their enemy in the animation until reaching the ground, to negate Fall Damage.\n\nStamina Loss\nAt falls of 4 meters and above, 25 Stamina is drained upon landing.\nAt falls of 8 meters and above, 50 Stamina is drained upon landing.\n\nThis can only be experienced during combat.\nThese are fixed breakpoints that do not scale (e.g. a fall of 7.9 meters still only drains 25 stamina).\nThese amounts are unaffected by your stats, and this also has no impact on HP loss.\n\nFalling for Too Long\nIf the player gets stuck in a falling animation they can't escape from, a hidden timer set to ~12 seconds results in death. The length of this timer may be shortened to ~3 seconds in some out-of-bounds locations. If the player does manage to land before the timer completes, the extra time spent falling won't increase Fall Damage nor change the height of a lethal fall.\n\nTorrent, Double Jumping and Fall Damage\nWhile riding Torrent, fall damage is reduced by a multiplier of 0.7, but the breakpoints for damage and death are still at 16 and 20m falls, respectively. However, there are a few quirks to consider:\n\nDouble-jumping doesn't make falls any safer or more dangerous, as the game only considers the vertical distance between the ledge you fell from and the ground you ultimately end up on. This means you cannot double jump slightly before landing to protect yourself from a lethal fall.\nThe ability to double-jump after falling is lost at around 20m and beyond.\nWielding certain weapon classes while mounted on Torrent will require you to jump off of a ledge in order to double-jump at all, making it so that walking off of a ledge doesn't allow double-jumping. This is likely a bug, and it applies to the following weapons: Greatswords, Colossal Swords, Heavy Thrusting Swords, Curved Greatswords, Greataxes, Great Hammers, Colossal Weapons, Spears, Great Spears, Halberds, Twinblades, and Reapers.\nLanding on uneven or sloped surfaces while riding Torrent and then immediately jumping again will sometimes cause the game to not register a short instance of being on the ground. If this happens, the game will continue to use your initial falling location for the height calculation, so be careful when descending cliffs or structures while riding Torrent.\n\nScripted Locations and Kill Boxes\nCertain locations are scripted to allow for greater falls without suffering damage. These are often in the form of floor breakaways, such as the drop that leads to the lesser Crucible Knight in Stormveil Castle, and a few spots in the Divine Tower of Caelid.\n\nThe player does not need to trigger or make contact with the breakable floor surface first. As long as they land on the piece of ground that's considered safe, the fall will not be lethal.\nAs of Patch 1.03, jumping attacks will no longer cause the player to die from an otherwise safe fall.\n\nKill boxes and death planes are areas which cause instant death if the player passes through them, disregarding the height of a fall. These are often used in places where the players is not expected to recover from their fall (e.g., high cliffs, elevator shafts, and bridges).\nOccasionally, these areas are not properly implemented and can trigger the "deathcam" (a top-down camera view) while the player is still alive. During this state, certain systems in the game are prone to failing (e.g., fog gates are missing).\n\nFall Damage Notes & Tips\n\nJumping off of a ledge as opposed to walking off of a ledge, while walking or riding Torrent, does increase the height of a given fall by a little bit. It's recommended to always walk and fall from the lowest point you can, unless jumping will get you to a landing location that is higher, to reduce your total fall distance.\nUsing a light attack as you are falling will cancel the normal landing animation and allow you to recover more quickly from medium to large falls, at the cost of the Stamina used to attack (if the player is currently in combat). This is similar to rolling immediately after landing in the previous Souls games, though it will not reduce the loss of stamina or health.\nWith a Rainbow Stone, the player can test if a fall is a guaranteed death (longer that 20m). If the Rainbow Stone shatters mid-air, then the fall is deadly. Note that Glowstones do not share this property, despite their similarity.\n\n
