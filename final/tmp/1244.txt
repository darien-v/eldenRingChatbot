CONTEXT
\n\n Strength \n\nType\nMain Attribute\n\nEffects\nAttribute required to wield heavy armaments.Also boosts attacks power of strength-scaling armaments and affects your Physical Defense.\n\nStrength is one of the Stats in Elden Ring. Stats refer to various properties that govern your character's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how they are affected by interactions in and out of combat. Strength primarily affects a player's ability to wield Strength-based Armaments, as well as the damage dealt by such weapons. It is one of the 8 Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on to level up, increasing the Stat's effectiveness and influencing their relative secondary stats. Stats such as Strength are an important aspect of character progression in Elden Ring.\n\nElden Ring Strength Stat General Information\n\nStrength (STR) is a Main Attribute that primarily allows the wielding of Strength-based Armaments (Weapons). It also acts as the primary modifier that influences the damage dealt by such weapons.\nWeapons in Elden Ring have a minimum Stat requirement that needs to be met before the weapon can be wielded. Most weapons require investment in either the Strength or Dexterity stats, or a combination of both. For example, Ordovis' Greatsword requires 14 STR and 8 DEX to equip. Some weapons may also require points in Intelligence, Faith or Arcane in order to wield. This is especially true for spell-based weapons such as Glintstone Staves and Sacred Seals.\nWeapons are also given a Scaling Grade denoting the degree to which they scale with an attribute. Each point allocated to the Strength stat increases the damage dealt by weapons with Strength scaling. A weapon with a Strength scaling grade of S will benefit the most from the Strength Attribute, followed by grades A, B, C, D, and E.\nNote that attributes will incur diminishing returns at higher levels, significantly reducing their benefits after a certain point with regards to weapon scaling. This is often referred to as the 'Soft Cap'. A 'Hard Cap' also exists in which additional points in an attribute returns little to no benefit.\nWhen scaling the attack power of a melee armament, like all stats, Strength soft caps differ depending on the weapon and the damage type being scaled. Scaling on physical damage is often 18/60/80 by default, 20/60/80 on heavy affinities and some unique weapons, and 16/60/80 on quality affinities. Strength has a hard cap of 150 when scaling physical damage. Note that in the rare case that magic, fire, lightning, or holy scales on strength, the soft caps are always 20/50/80 with a hard cap at 99, even when two-handing.\nWhen scaling the incantation scaling of the Clawmark Seal or the Frenzied Flame Seal, Strength soft caps are 15/30/45.\nWielding an Armament with two hands will multiply your Strength with that armament by 1.5. If an armament scales with Strength, it will deal more damage when used two-handed. In addition, strength requirements can be met by two-handing. To wield an armament with both hands, press Triangle + L1/R1.\nStrength is the only attribute that can virtually increase beyond 99. This is not shown to the player. Wielding an armament with two hands while at 99 strength will grant 148 virtual strength, but 150 strength is possible with the help of strength-boosting equipment. Without two-handing, up to 126 strength can be achieved with strength-boosting equipment. (strength can no longer be increased beyond 99 with equipment. Only wielding a weapon 2-handed increases damage derived from the STR stat at 99 STR).\nThe following armaments are not given a strength bonus when two-handed due to being dual-wielded instead: \n\nAll 4 Claws\nAll 9 Fists\nOrnamental Straight Sword\n\nNote that despite the fact that Starscourge Greatsword is dual-wielded rather than two-handed, the weapon still receives the two-handed strength bonus for non-paired attacks and can be properly wielded below strength requirement when two-handing despite the game showing otherwise. Paired attacks do not receive the two-handed strength bonus.\n\nHow to Increase Strength in Elden Ring?\nStrength is one of the Main Attributes that players can spend Runes on in order to level up.\n\nThe ability to level up is unlocked after meeting Melina at the Gatefront Site of Grace.\nLeveling up can be done at any Site of Grace once unlocked.\nThe amount of Runes required to raise an Attribute increases with each character Level.\nRunes are obtained primarily by defeating Enemies and Bosses. Certain consumables such as the Fringefolk's Rune can also be used to gain a fixed number of runes.\n\nStrength can be increased by using various Strength-boosting Equipment and Effects:\n\nOmensmirk Mask: Increases Strength by 2 while equipped.\nImp Head (Fanged): Increases Strength by 2 while equipped.\nHaima Glintstone Crown: Increases Strength by 2 while equipped.\nStarscourge Heirloom Talisman: Increases Strength by 5 while equipped.\nRadagon's Scarseal/Soreseal Talisman: Increases Strength by 3/5 (respectively) while equipped.\nGodrick's Great Rune: Increases Strength by 5 while active; the effect lasts until death.\nStrength-knot Crystal Tear: Increases Strength by 10 while active; the effect lasts for 3 minutes.\nOath of Vengeance (Grafted Blade Greatsword weapon Skill): Increases Strength by 5 while active; the effect lasts for 60 seconds.\n\nLevel Progression for Strength in Elden Ring\n\nImproving Strength grants a small boost to Physical Defense, reducing damage taken from sources of Physical Damage, including enemy attacks and special abilities. Boosting Strength beyond 99 does not increase Physical Defense. \n\n+0.33 Physical Defense per level from 1 to 30 Strength\n+0.5 Physical Defense per level from 31 to 40 Strength\n+0.75 Physical Defense per level from 41 to 60 Strength\n+0.25 Physical Defense per level from 61 to 99 Strength\n\nElden Ring Strength Builds\n\nBarbarian Written Guide\n\nBerserker Written Guide\n\nChampion Written Guide\n\nColossal Knight Written Guide\n\nMagic Archer Written Guide\n\nBlazing Bushido Written Guide\n\nArcher Written Guide\n\nColossus Guardian Written Guide\n\nBlasphemous Beastmaster Written Guide\n\nScorching Slayer Written Guide\n\nCold-Blooded Raptor Written Guide\n\nGravity God Written Guide\n\nColdstorm Build Written Guide\n\nElden Ring Gold Breaker Build Written Guide\n\nWarrior of Waves Elden Ring Build\n\nElden Ring Tower Knight Build Guide\n\nElden Ring Strength Notes & Tips\n\nNotes & Tips go here.\n\nStats in Elden Ring\n\nArcane  ♦  Dexterity  ♦  Discovery  ♦  Endurance  ♦  Equip Load  ♦  Faith  ♦  Fire Damage Negation  ♦  Fire Defense  ♦  Focus  ♦  Focus Resistance  ♦  FP  ♦  Holy Damage Negation  ♦  Holy Defense  ♦  HP  ♦  Immunity  ♦  Immunity Resistance  ♦  Intelligence  ♦  Level  ♦  Lightning Damage Negation  ♦  Lightning Defense  ♦  Magic Damage Negation  ♦  Magic Defense  ♦  Memory Slots  ♦  Mind  ♦  Physical Defense  ♦  Poise  ♦  Robustness  ♦  Robustness Resistance  ♦  Runes Held  ♦  Stamina  ♦  Vigor  ♦  Vitality  ♦  VS Pierce Damage Negation  ♦  VS Pierce Defense  ♦  VS Slash Damage Negation  ♦  VS Slash Defense  ♦  VS Strike Damage Negation  ♦  VS Strike Defense  ♦  Weight\n\n
