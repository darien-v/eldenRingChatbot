CONTEXT
\n\n Jar Bairn 小壺 \n\nLocation\nJarburg, Liurnia of the Lakes\n\nRole\nQuest NPC\n\nVoiced by\nGrace Saif\n\nJar Bairn is an NPC in Elden Ring. Jar Bairn is a small living jar NPC that can be found sitting on top of some stairs at the west end of Jarburg. Their quest is tied to Iron Fist Alexander and Diallos.\n\n Hello coz, what are you doing here?\n\nJar Bairn Location in Elden Ring\nJar Bairn can be found at Jarburg.\n\nThis NPC moves.\nThis NPC can be fought.\nDoesn't drop anything upon defeat.\n\nJar Bairn Questline: How to complete Jar Bairn's Quest\n\nJar-Bairn can be found in Jarburg and will ask you to become Potentate, but deems your hands too rough.\nDestroying any of the living jars in Jarburg will anger Jar-Bairn and render this questline inaccessible.\nNote: Jar-Bairn will start sleeping, mumbling about the "Wide World" until you meet/save Alexander at least once.\nReload the area and talk to Jar-Bairn multiple times, until their dialogue is exhausted. The stopping point here is where Jar-Bairn talks about poachers. You need to reload by using the site of grace multiple times until you get the dialogue about poachers.\n(Optional)\n\nProgressing Diallos's questline in Volcano Manor until he leaves will cause him to move to Jarburg. \n\nKilling Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy before completing the questline and then talking to Diallos will also cause him to move.\n\nReload the area multiple times and talk to Diallos (who appear in one of the houses in the area) and Jar Bairn until Diallos tells you not to pity him and Jar Bairn laments they'd like to have a stronger Potentate.\nAfter exhausting Alexander's dialogue in Radahn's Arena after Radahn's defeat, return here to find several of the jars destroyed. The mortally wounded Diallos will be lying in the center of Jarburg, and ask if he successfully defended the jars from the poachers. Jar-Bairn is a little bit south from Diallos's location, behind his legs. \n\nIf you have defeated Radahn and have already talked to Alexander in his location, but Jarburg has not been attacked, you should go to the Starcourge Radahn Site of Grace, and then back to Jarburg.\nIt is possible that one night cycle may be required to progress this quest. Try resting at the site of grace in Jarburg and "Pass Time until nightfall" to force the poacher attack to occur.\n\nReload the area, and speak to Jar-Bairn as he's attempting to inherit some of Diallos's power from his remains.\n\nReload the area once again, and speak to Jar Bairn, who will now be seated where he initially was. He will speak of going on a journey to become a Warrior Jar. Give them Alexander's Innards, which you receive for completing Alexander's questline, and reload the area again.\nReceive the Companion Jar Talisman from where Jar-Bairn was previously seated. You can also find Diallos's Mask and Hoslow's Petal Whip in the middle of town.\nNote: Not to confuse with Juno Hoslow, who is Diallos's brother. \n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Jar Bairn\nIntroduction\n\nHallo coz, what are you doing here? I didn't think anyone knew about this place, 'cept us jars. Oh! Are you going to be the new Potentate?\n\nAnswering "I'll be your Potentate."\n\nGosh, truly? That's wonderful news! It's not easy being Potentate, though. I know, show me your hands. It's just a little test, coz, to see if you've got the right stuff. Hmm. Your skin isn't so smooth, is it... You need slick, slidey hands to be Potentate, you know. I'm sorry coz, but I don't think you've got what it takes... What a shame...\n\nAnswering "No, I'm not your Potentate."\n\nOh, well, I'm sorry.\n\nTalking again after responding "No, I'm not your Potentate."\n\nCoz. You'll be our Potentate after all, then?\n\nWhen found sleeping (before freeing Alexander the first time and after Jar-Bairn's dialogue about flowers)\n\n...\nCoz...\nTell me a story... About the big, wide world...\n...\n\nVisit\n\nDon't look so glum, coz. We can still chat, Potentate or not. Come back and visit me, when you can.\nOh, hallo again coz. I'm happy you came back. I have good tidings for you, coz. Have you noticed the rare flowers growing in this village? I asked the villagers if you could pick some of them. And they said you'd be very welcome!\nGo on, coz, you really should pick some of our flowers. Who knows, they might be of some use.\nAh, hallo again. Say, coz. Have you met Uncle Alexander? He used to live here with us, but then he left, to be a champion. I asked to go with him, but he said "The path of champions must be trod alone". So heroic, right? I miss him though. If you see him, you should ask him to teach you how to fight, coz. He's big and tough and strong!\nUncle Alexander said he won't be back again. "My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country." I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it. So...please don't tell anyone, coz, but... I'm actually a warrior jar as well! One day, I'll be just like Uncle Alexander. And I'll have to leave the village to become a champion.\nAh, hallo again. Do you know what a poacher is, coz? They hunt us, smash us, and then take us away. This village is kept secret, so I think we're safe here. But you should be careful if you ever meet one of them, coz. I hope uncle Alexander beats them all up, first...\n\nWhen found sleeping, he will sometimes say these lines.\n\n”…Uncle Alexander, look!It’s me! I’m a warrior jar too!”\n“… Stop, no…Please, no, don’t break us…”\n\nWhen Diallos arrives at Jarburg\n\nOh, hello again, cos! Have you heard, a new Potentate's coming to the village! I think he said his name was Diallos. He seems a little down in the dumps, but his hands! As smooth as silk!\nI don't know. I'm a little disappointed actually. Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour... He says he isn't a warrior. And since he's a coward he won't be fighting anymore. His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us. But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you.\n\nAfter Diallos arrives at Jarburg (while sleeping)\n\n... They're wonderful, Diallos. So smooth, and silky... ...\n\nAfter Jarburg is attacked\n\nO-oh! Coz! I'm glad you came. But we're fine now. Diallos fought the poacher. Though quite a lot of us got broken... I won't cry though... I'm a warrior jar. A warrior. "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."  That's the kind of warrior I want to be one day, coz. Even if I'm scared, I'll still fight to protect everyone.\n\n §After completing Iron Fist Alexander's questline「アレキサンダーの中身」渡す\n\nThanks for coming back, coz.\n\nI've been thinking.\n\nIt's time for me to set out on a journey.\n\nAs a warrior jar, upon the path of champions.\n\n(If player chooses to 'Give Alexander's Insides')\n\nWow, coz, are these... Insides?\n\nFrom Uncle Alexander?\n\n... Thank you, coz.\n\nI'm a warrior jar, so I need to be strong.\n\nI can really have them, right?\n\nI understand.\n\nI'll get strong.\n\nStrong enough I deserve to have Uncle's insides.\n\nI don't think I'll see you again, when I set out.\n\nWarriors are supposed to work alone.\n\nGoodbye, coz.\n\nAnd thanks for everything.\n\nI'll never forget you, coz.\n\nWhen attacked\n\nOh? What's the matter, coz? Don't be such a nasty brute.\n\nUpon Death\n\n...So, this is who you are, coz... You've cracked my heart. Please, don't crack the others...\nSo, you were a poacher, too. But the tale of house Hoslow is told in blood. I'll find you, one day, coz...\n\nElden Ring Jar Bairn Notes & Trivia\n\nYou do not need to give Jar Bairn Alexander's Innards to activate the attack on Jarburg if attempting to complete Diallos's questline.\nJar Bairn will sometimes be found sleeping at times, dreaming about various things, like the poachers, Alexander, and Diallos.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
