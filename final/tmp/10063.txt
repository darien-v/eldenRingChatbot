CONTEXT
\nColosseum is a Free DLC released for Elden Ring on December 7th, 2022. It opens up the three previously inaccessible Colosseums located in Limgrave, Caelid and Leyndell. Players will be able to access them to engage in battle in new and diverse modes. Duels, free-for-alls and team fights are many of the modes available in the Colosseums for up to 6 players.\n\nSee Patch Notes for details on balancing changes that accompany the Colosseum Arena DLC.\n\nColosseum Update Information\nThe Colosseum DLC is free and available on all platforms for all players. Given the changes introduced to balancing in Patch 1.07.1, PvP and PvE balancing are now different, allowing for the arenas to open and introduce new game modes.\nPlayers can expect some additional content with the arenas, but it is expected that it will behave much like the Hollow Arena in Dark Souls 3.\nPvP Colosseums - The Colosseum doors open for the first time to reveal a new challenge, unlocking three new arenas. Located in Limgrave, Caelid and Leyndell, each arena comes with its own sets of rules and will be theatres of fierce Player versus Player confrontations.\nThe Limgrave Colosseum features two modes: United Combat and Combat Ordeal.\n\nIn United Combat, combatants will be divided into two teams to fight in timed battles with the ability to respawn. Each death and respawn grants points to the adversaries, offering victory to the team with the higher score.\nIn Combat Ordeal, it’s every Tarnished for themselves. Combatants in this mode can also respawn until the timer hits zero, and the one with the most points will prevail as victor.\n\nThe Royal Colosseum, located in Leyndell, features Duel Mode. Two Tarnished face off in a duel to the death, and without the ability to respawn.\nThe Caelid Colosseum features all aforementioned modes with the addition of being able to summon Spirit Ashes to fight by players’ sides. Only combats held at the Caelid Colosseum allow the use of Spirit Ashes.\nJoin the fight on your own or use group passwords to match up with or against friends, and prove your worth in the Colosseums!\nCosmetics – Five new hairstyles also await players returning to their adventure in ELDEN RING or taking on the new challenges in the Colosseums.\n\nColosseum PVP New Areas Available\n\nCaelid Colosseum\nLeyndell Colosseum (Royal Colosseum)\nLimgrave Colosseum\n\nElden Ring Colosseum Update New PVP Modes:\nUp to 6 players can:\n\nDuel Mode: Two Tarnished face off in a duel to the death, and without the ability to respawn.
