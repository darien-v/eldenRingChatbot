Is somebody there?Might I bend your ear for a moment, please.My name is Irina. I've escaped from Castle Morne, to the south.The servants there...have rebelled.I-I can't be sure what it is; my eyesight's been weak since birth you see...But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over.My good father secreted me out the castle,but decided himself to stay.He says it's his duty, as commander.\nI... I fear for father's life.The servants are full wroth. Filled with hatred for every one of us.They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with. They haven't spared a soul.I fear it's no different at Castle Morne...Please, I implore you.Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?My sole wish is that he escape, even if his honour should be the price.Please... I just want him to be safe...\n\nIf attacked\n\nAgh! Ah, why on earth? I do not wish to cause anyone harm.\n(On player kill) Oh, bless the stars. You've chosen to reconsider.\n\nIf killed\n\nFather... Please, be safe...\n\nIf accepting to deliver the letter\n\nThank you, dearly.Then please, take this.[Gives Irina's Letter]Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please.\nPlease, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle.He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around.\n\nElden Ring Irina Notes & Trivia\nNote: Irina can be killed as a method of anointing the Lord of Blood's Favor, rather than using the other two maidens intended. She does not retaliate with more than a damageless Rejection spell when struck. This method of anointing the favor will not work if she is slain by the Misbegotten during hers and Edgar's storylines. It has no functional impact on hers, Edgar's, or even Varre's dialogue or stories however, as Edgar can still be delivered the letter off her corpse, Varre has no dialogue for killing Irina, and Irina dies shortly after accessing Castle Morne regardless.\nIf attacked\n\nAgh! Ah, why on earth? I do not wish to cause anyone harm.\n(On player kill) Oh, bless the stars. You've chosen to reconsider.\n\nIf killed\n\nFather... Please, be safe...\n\nOther Notes on Irina\n\nNear Irina, on the way to Castle Morne, lies a Hearse ambushed by the Misbegotten. These are, presumably, what is left of Irina's escort. \n\nIn that Hearse you can find the Morning Star mace.\n\nAt Revenger's Shack, Edgar appears as a hostile invader in the form of Edgar the Revenger, with the shack covered in dead bodies and Raw Meat Dumplings. The bodies don't appear to be Misbegotten, who Edgar swore to slay every last one of, so it is unknown why they were targeted instead.\nIrina's appearance and blindness is similar to that of the Hyetta. Her father, Edgar, also drops a Shabriri Grape upon death, which are the items that Hyetta must eat to continue on her path to becoming a finger maiden. Possibly, like Hyetta, Irina was meant to become a finger maiden. It is unclear whether the Shabriri Grape that Edgar drops was something he was simply holding, intended to be given to Irina, or is literally his eyeball. \n\nIt may be possible that after Irina's death, her body was taken over by Hyetta, just like Yura's body was taken over by Shabriri, after his demise. However, even after meeting Hyetta, Irina's body remains where it is.\nIrina can be used to bloody the Lord of Blood's Favor item from the White Mask Varre questline if you kill her. Does not work if she is already dead.\n\n"Irina of Morne" is a clear reference to Dark Souls 3 as both she and Irina of Carim are blind, and Eygon, a character close to Irina, wears the Morne's Armor set.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
