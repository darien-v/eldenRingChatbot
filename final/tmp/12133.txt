CONTEXT
\nDragon Communion Incantations are a group of Incantations in Elden Ring that share a specific type of buff criteria. Dragon Communion Incantations revolve around draconic powers, mostly breath attacks and are one of the two available Dragon Incantations options for players, alongside Dragon Cult Incantations. They require Faith and Arcane in order to be casted.\nThere are a total of 14 Dragon Communion Incantations, including Placidusax's Ruin, available for players. Dragon Communion Incantations can be purchased in certain altars in the game and use  Dragon Heart as currency, instead of   Runes. Defeating Dragons throughout the Land Betweens is the most common way of obtaining them.\nNote: Placidusax's Ruin is not a Dragon Communion incantation. It has no Arcane requirement, and receives no buff from the Dragon Communion Seal.  It can be acquired by trading the Remembrance of the Dragonlord with Enia at Roundtable Hold.\n\nBestial\n\nBlood\n\nDragon Communion\n\nDragon Cult\n\nErdtree\n\nFire Giant\n\nFire Monks\n\nFrenzied Flame\n\nGodskin Apostles\n\nGolden Order\n\nServants of Rot\n\nTwo Fingers\n\nDragon Communion Incantations info\n\nObtaining Dragon Communion Incantations\n\nChurch of Dragon Communion, located in Limgrave. You have to pass through the Coastal Cave to reach this area. Map Link\nCathedral of Dragon Communion, can be located in Caelid. Map Link.\nMany Dragon Communion Incantations, specially Breath attacks, are "tied" to a Dragon Boss. This means that you need to defeat the Dragon that is related to that Incantation, to unlock it for purchase. For example, defeating Flying Dragon Agheel, unlocks Agheel's Flame for purchase.\nThe named Dragon breath attacks (such as Agheel's Flame) deal about 17% more damage than the basic version (such as Dragonfire), except for Theodorix's Magma, which deals 41% more. They can also be cast in mid air.\nAs you obtain more Incantations your eyes will change to resemble a dragon's. It requires spending four dragon hearts to cause the change. The whites of your eyes turn black and your irises gold. Your pupils also become slits. If your eyes have already been changed by Varre's questline or the Frenzied Flame, you will not receive the draconic eyes, regardless of the number of Dragon Hearts spent.\n\nDragon Communion Incantations Requirements\n\nAs is the case with all Incantations, you must have a Sacred Seal equipped in order to be able to cast Dragon Communion Incantations.\nDragon Communion Incantations require Faith and Arcane to use.\nDragon Communion Incantations cost a varying amount of Dragon Hearts. (From 1 to 3) They are dropped by Dragons.\n\nBoosting Dragon Communion Incantations\n\nDragon Communion Seal provides a boost in effectiveness for all Dragon Communion Incantations.\nAs of patch 1.09,  Roar Medallion raises damage of various breath based incantations by 10% in PvE and 5% in PvP.
