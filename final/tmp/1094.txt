Ancestral Follower can also work well.\nThe crystalline "body" has greater defense than the hand-like limbs or head, but can be attacked while staying out of range of most attacks barring shockwaves.\nOnce it teleports, face your camera upwards to see if it's preparing to grab you.\n\nMelee Users\nAt the start of the encounter it will likely fire a laser that can deal massive damage to you on the spot. Dodge through it and, if you want it, summon your Spirit Ashes. Dodge through its attacks up until you reach it and, by then, stay on its head while dodging every attack. It has a lot of AoE skills that might one or two-shot you so stay on the safe side and slowly chip away its HP. If you summoned your Spirit Ashes - they'll often distract him which gives you plenty of opportunities to get some attacks in.Don't get hit by its bite attack. It'll be indicated by the mandibles glowing purple on its face. It is easily dodged but can deal massive damage if it connects.Around 50%, Astel will teleport away and cast Meteorite of Astel on you. Dodge through them or run towards the sides, as even one of them can break through your guard and deal heavy damage. The fight itself doesn't change as its HP goes down, so if you're doing everything right, you'll have it downed in no time.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nLongbow users may use Poison or Rot Arrows to trigger either status effects. You must hit Astel several times in a row to proc the status ailment, missing too many shots will allow its poison or rot buildup to go down faster than you can build it. If you have enough HP to tank a few hits, the Pulley Crossbow can apply status effects very fast. The status effects can be reapplied again once they have worn off. The Ash of War: Enchanted Shot is highly recommended while using these arrows to ensure you are not missing and wasting them. While it is poisoned or rotting, you may continue to do ranged battle with regular arrows. You can also conserve FP by switching down to R1 attacks. With the Arrow's Reach Talisman, you can ensure these R1 attacks will land without damage loss due to distance, giving an acceptable chip damage if your Longbow is at least +12.\nFor magic users, A high-intelligence build can do a lot of damage in a short period of time. Using Comet Azur with a Flask of Wondrous Physick (Cerulean Hidden Tear + Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear) after dodging the initial attacks is a good combination to try. After this attack, try staying at medium-long range where a sorcery like Great Glintstone Shard can hit him. If you use these types of spells, you can attack quick enough to dodge many of its attacks while still doing fairly decent damage. For lower intelligence casters, Night Maiden's Mist isn't a terrible option, although it is decently fast and can move out of it from time to time. Pairing the mist with glintstone pebble can make efficient use of your FP without needing much investment. Additionally charged Shard Spiral can deal a ton of damage provided you stay close to the boss (make sure to equip Godfrey Icon if using this strategy for 15% extra damage). \n\nAstel, Naturalborn of the Void Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nCosmic Burst\nAstel raises its head high, summoning a purple orb in its jaws. After a delay, it fires an extremely fast beam that deals high damage and heavy knockback.\nWait for a slight second before dodging to the side or head-on into the beam.  Blocking can also help.\n\nWaves of Darkness\nAstel creates three orbs on its arms, before slamming it down and create shockwave that pulses three times, with a higher radius each time\nRun away from it or block to reduce damage. The "pulse" is too quick for Medium and Heavy builds to dodge.  It is also possible to jump over the crest of the shockwaves.\n\nLarge Wave of Darkness\nAstel rises up high, summoning orbs on all six of its arms before slamming down, creating a larger wave that increases four times before dissipating.\nThis attack has a very high windup. Once you see Astel fly upwards, run away immediately. \n\nTail Slam\nAstel raises its tail high and slams it down before repeating once again. This is usually down at medium to long range.\nDodge left or right. Getting close enough will avoid this attack completely.\n\nTail Sting\nAstel positions its tail above its head, indicated by the tail shaking slightly before striking the ground three times.\nHighly telegraphed, you can rush forward and hit its head while it is busy doing this move.\n\nNebula\nSwipes its hands in varying patterns, leaving behind an exploding cloud of stars. The entire arm of Astel becomes a hitbox, making this move hard to avoid.\nDodge to the sides. Dodging backwards or forwards is ill advised.\n\nBite\nAstel clicks its mandibles and chomps down its target once or twice. Usually used when a target is close in front of it.\nThis attack comes out very quickly and can deal high damage. Dodge toward its head to avoid it.\n\nTeleport\nAstel raises its hands, forming an orb around itself. After a delay, Astel will teleport either above the player or far away. The teleport itself will also do damage.\nRun away from the teleportation. In case of attack from above - watch your surroundings and prepare to dodge.\n\nMeteorite of Astel\nAt around half health, it will use a Teleport to get away. After that it’ll start casting a large shower of meteors to bombard the area in front of it.\nRun to the sides or attempt to dodge through it. The meteors can be quite inaccurate, but they hit very hard when they connect.\n\nReverse Gravity\nAstel begins charging up, and after a few seconds it will lift the player into the air before slamming them down violently. The first part of the attack is what “grabs” the player, but the second part can also damage as well.\nOnce you see a pink glow around the boss, prepare to run away. If you time it good enough, you can dodge through the first part of the attack and get some free hits.The “grab” portion of this attack only affects “NPCs” like the player, any summoned allies, Mimic Tear, and the Puppets (excluding Nightmaiden and Swordstress)\n\nDiving Grab\nAfter a Teleport, Astel positions itself directly above its target and grabs them, shoving them into their massive pincers and often killing them instantly.\nTilt your camera up to see if Astel teleported above, then dodge into and under it as its head moves forward for the grab.\n\nCrushing Bite\nAstel's jaws glow and flash purple before biting. If the attack lands, the target will be lifted off the ground in a gravity bubble before being crushed, dealing massive damage.\nThis attack has an obvious windup and is very short ranged, dodge forward or run away.\n\nAstel, Naturalborn of the Void Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nThe magic seal just beyond the boss can be broken by killing the Baleful Shadow as directed by Ranni. Use the Discarded Palace Key you receive afterwards on the locked chest in the Raya Lucaria Grand Library. The seal will disappear upon your return.\nThe description of the Remembrance of the Naturalborn implies a connection between Astel and the Fallingstar Beast, both being creatures that fell from the stars. Astel is a fully grown Malformed Star and is responsible for destroying one of the Eternal Cities, possibly the Nameless City found in the Deeproot Depths.\nAn unused animation shows Astel descending from the sky while playing the sound of a roaring fire. It could've been plausible for Astel to crash-land during or after the fight with Radahn, as he had conquered the stars to prevent Astel and its spawn from arriving to the Lands Between. However, this concept never came to, and was likely reworked into Radahn's Meteor Crash attack, making them both into separate fights.\nAs of patch 1.03, there is a known bug that may disconnect players who are summoned in co-op fights. \nEarlier in game-life cycle (1.0), boss was known as Astel, Misbegotten of the Void\n\nAstel, Naturalborn of the Void Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
