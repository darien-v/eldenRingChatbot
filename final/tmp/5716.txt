QUESTION
Why is the Giant's Red Braid more suited for Strength/Faith builds compared to Dexterity/Faith builds?

ANSWER
The Giant's Red Braid is more suited for Strength/Faith builds compared to Dexterity/Faith builds due to its scaling primarily with Strength, Dexterity, and Faith, making it more beneficial for users with higher Strength investment.
