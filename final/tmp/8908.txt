CONTEXT
\n\n Gatekeeper Gostoc \n\nLocation\nStormveil Castle Entrance\n\nRole\nNPC and Merchant\n\nVoiced by\nBen Fox\n\nGatekeeper Gostoc is an NPC in Elden Ring. Gatekeeper Gostoc is an old tall fellow that may seem a bit suspicious, but he seems to want to help. It is your choice to trust him or not.\nIf  you die within Stormveil Castle, he will steal 30% of any runes dropped when dying.  However, the area outside of the castle where the Warhawks are at is safe from rune-theft if you die there.\n\nGatekeeper Gostoc Location in Elden Ring\n\nGatekeeper Gostoc can be found by the entrance of Stormveil Castle, in the room next to the main gate into the castle. [Map Link]\nAfter defeating Godrick, Gostoc moves to the Godrick the Grafted Site of Grace, stomping on his remains.\nIf defeated, drops:\n\nGostoc's Bell Bearing\nSilver Pickled Fowl Foot\nGlass Shard\n\nGatekeeper Gostoc Questline: How to complete Gatekeeper Gostoc's Quest\nCastle Siege\n\nGatekeeper Gostoc advises you to avoid entering the castle using the main gate because he says it's tightly guarded. He suggests you to try the opening through the other way, claiming that guards don't know about that entrance. You will be given the choice to accept or reject his suggestion. \n\nIf you accept the offer, he will wish you luck and send you on your way to the side path.\nIf you reject the offer, he will seemingly respect your decision and open the gate for you. \n\nOnce you have obtained the Rusty Key or defeated Godrick, or catch him at one the 3 locations stalking you, he will start to provide merchant services. \nGostoc at first may seem to want to help the player, although in a suspicious manner. This is however just a facade. He will actually steal 30% of your runes every time you die in the castle, even if you enter it through the main gate.\nAfter passing through specific trigger points, Gostoc will appear in certain locations behind the player. He will give you a Grace Mimic the first time you speak to him at one of these locations. He will not appear at them if you already opened the main gate of the castle. Otherwise, Gostoc can be found at these locations: \n\nRuined Watchtower, behind the Stormveil Cliffside site of grace and must walk up the side path and into the room with 2 servants sitting on the ground for him to appear here. \n\nHe appears on the cliff overlooking the Stormveil Cliffside site of grace.\n\nInside the rampart tower. \n\nAfter you exit out to the ramparts with the stormhawks carrying explosive barrels, go to the balcony area along the ramparts and drop down to the ledge. Keep dropping down till you find a teardrop scarab and fight a crucible knight guarding a lift. When you take the lift back up, Gostoc will be near the lift examining a corpse.\nAlternatively, going out to the ramparts with the stormhawks and crossing the first ledge may cause him to spawn at the corpse near the lift.\n\nOn the castle chapel roof, above Sorcerer Rogier. \n\nGo to the wooden balcony above the grafted scion and double back outside to the long path with the banished knight and torchpole soldier, Gostoc will be on the roof overlooking the path. He will not appear here if you have already spoken to him at any of the previous locations.\n\nWhen you enter a dark room containing the Rusty Key, the door will close behind you and you can hear Gostoc's laugh. This will leave you alone with a dangerous Banished Knight. \n\nIf you kill Gostoc beforehand, you won't be locked into the room containing the Rusty Key.\n\nAfter defeating Godrick, Gostoc will move to the boss room and begin stomping on the corpse, cursing Godrick for treating him badly. As of 1.04 he continues to be a merchant.\nKilling Gostoc will not lock you out of Nepheli Loux and Kenneth Haight's quest as it can still be completed without him, but you will miss out on the Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone and won't be able to buy it from the Twin Maiden Husks even if you gave them his bell bearing.\n\nNew Lord\n\nOnce Nepheli Loux has been given The Stormhawk King, Kenneth Haight has regained control of his fort and Morgott has been defeated then Gostoc and the other two NPCs will move the Godrick's Throne Room. At this point Gostoc re-opens his shop and has a new item: an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone\n\nElden Ring Gatekeeper Gostoc Shop\nGatekeeper Gostoc will open his store after you obtained the Rusty Key from Stormveil Castle.\n\nItem Name\nItem Type\nPurchase Value\nStock\n\nSilver-Pickled Fowl Foot\nConsumable\n2000\n3\n\nRuin Fragment\nMaterials\n100\n5\n\nFurlcalling Finger Remedy\nConsumable\n1000\n4\n\nFestering Bloody Finger\nConsumable\n1000\n2\n\nStormhawk Feather\nMaterials\n500\n5\n\nCaestus\nFist Weapon \n800\n1\n\nGreat Arrow\nArrows and Bolts\n300\n5\n\nBallista Bolt\nArrows and Bolts\n300\n5\n\nBuckler\nShields\n1500\n1\n\nBandit Garb\nArmor\n1500\n1\n\nBandit Manchettes\nArmor\n1000\n1\n\nBandit Boots\nArmor\n1000\n1\n\nAncient Dragon Smithing Stone\nUpgrade Materials\n20000\n1\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Gatekeeper Gostoc\nIntroduction\n\n"You're Tarnished, aren't you?I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.Try the opening right here.The guards don't know about it.You'll breach the castle undetected."\n\nAnswering with "Very Well"\n\n"Yes, that's the spirit...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like. I pray for your success."\n\nVisit\n\nI've come into some fine goods. Only, it turns out I can't use a one of them. Perhaps you'd like to take them off my hands?\n\nWhen discovered by the player on the cliff overlooking the Stormveil Cliffside site of grace\n\nOh, oh, you... Oh, great, I'm glad you're here. Just a small reward, I was saving it for you. Please, its all yours.\n*Presents 1x Grace Mimic to the player*\n\nWhen spoken to again at this point\n\nGood, now let's be on our way, shall we? Wouldn't want the guards to spot you.\n\nWhen spoken to once again at this point. \n\nHop along, will you? What'll happen if the guards catch you strutting about?.\n\nIf the player dies to the trap, Gostoc will not appear in this spot after reviving. Instead, his encounter dialogue from this event will take place in another location.\n§The Death of Godrick\n\n What a pathetic excuse for a Lord you were. Craven to the bone. Pushing me about like that. And after all that grafting? Where did that get you? Look down on me, would you? Godrick? You filthy slug. Feel it! Feel it! Feel my bloody wrath! Oh...hello there. This weasel was...Godrick was always looking down on me. He got what he bloody deserved, thanks to you. I tell you though, what goes around comes around. He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and me the ugliest of ends, eh. He he he he he...Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate?  \n\nSmall Talk\n\n"Use that opening to breach the castle. The guards haven't a clue about it. You'll slip right inside undetected."\n\nWhen attacked\n\n"Blast, what's it to you! Step back, you wretched Tarnished!"\n(On player kill) "Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you..."\n\nWhen Killed\n\n"Damn it all.  Why is it always me?  What did I do to deserve..."\n\nWhen Killed after Godrick is dead\n\n"But I'm free...""I can do what I like"\n\nWhen Gostoc kills the player after Godrick is dead\n\n"Ha, do you feel it...""Do you feel my bloody wrath?"\n\nStormveil Castle Throne Room, after Nepheli Loux and Kenneth Haight have moved there\n\n"Ah, you, is it? Haven't seen your mug in quite some time.As you can see, I'm the new Lady's attendant.Freedom? Wasn't worth squat. B-besides, I like it 'round 'ere...Lady Nepheli's still fair of heart and countenance..."\n"Still, I have the Lady's trust....So I can loot all the corpses I like.I'll let you take a look at the goods, if you fancy."[Reopens shop]\n"Ah, back again, are we? Curious one, you are.Well then, what are you after?"\n\nElden Ring Notes & Trivia for Gatekeeper Gostoc\n\nGostoc being found hiding at difficult to access locations around the castle suggests he is stalking you to collect your runes after you die. He also presumably collects his goods from corpses in the fortress. \nCut dialogue suggested that he is the son of Godrick, and that there was an option to crown him as Ruler of Stormveil, instead of Nepheli. Should he received the crown in his cut questline, he would follow Godrick's footsteps and begin grafting himself.\nKilling the Banished Knight in the dark room before being locked in by Gostoc will result in him not closing the door behind you once you do enter, although you will still hear him laughing behind you.\nGatekeeper Gostoc is missing his left hand. Removal of one or both hands was a historical punishment for stealing. His arm may have also been taken for Grafting.\nThe graveyard after the fight with Godrick counts as castle grounds and he will steal your runes here as well.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
