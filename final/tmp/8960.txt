The trigger to make Yura disappear is entering the hall of Rold lift.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Bloody Finger Hunter Yura\nIntroduction\n\nAh, you must be the new Tarnished.You'd do well to steer clear of Agheel Lake, fledgling.A dragon roosts there... And it's as fearsome as it it majestic. So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...Stay clear of the lake.\nDon't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.\n\nDuring Bloody Finger Nerijus invasion\n\nIf it isn't Nerijus, The Bloody Finger. The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.\n\nAfter Bloody Finger Nerijus invasion\n\nAh, we meet again. To have fought Nerijus and lived, you must have seen your share of battle. I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers. Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them. Just remember, no kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it. Don't let your emotions stay your blade.\n\nIntroduction if not spoken to before Bloody Finger Nerijus Invasion\n\nJust joining the fray, Tarnished?Well, you fought Nerijus and survived. That alone deserves commendation.I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers.Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.Just remember. No Kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.Don't let your emotions stay your blade.\nOne last word of warning.Stay clear of Agheel Lake. A great dragon roosts there.And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...stay clear of the lake.\nBe on your way.Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.\n\nAfter dying to Agheel Lake Dragon, and returning to the Seaside Ruins location\n\nYou bloody halfwit. Picking a fight with a dragon? Well, I can tell you want to see it through. Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you. \nI can tell you want to see it through. Fools will be fools. Fight all the dragons you like.\n\n§After killing Agheel Lake Dragon, and returning to the Seaside Ruins location\n\nBeautiful work, felling that dragon. And as such there's something you might like to know. That heart you brought back, its used in Dragon Communion. If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength, then seek the decrepit church, on the little island off the western coast.\nYou must not forget though. Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity. Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens. Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment. The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly. Its no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous.\n\nAfter summoning Yura to help kill the Agheel Lake Dragon, and returning to the Seaside Ruins Location\n\nThere you are. That was my first dragon hunt in quite some time. Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.\nNow that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know. That heart you brought back, its used in Dragon Communion. If you should find yourself  overcome by hunger for the heart. yearning for its strength, then seek the decrepit church, on the little island  off the western coast.\nYou must not forget though. Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity. Their hunger for  dragon, their yearning, only worsens. Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment. The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly. Its no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous.\n\nOther\n\nBe on your way. Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.\n\nAfter invading Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin\n\nWretched worms, leave me be...\nAh, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there.That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him.Here's a token of thanks. Please take it.\nI may not have much time.I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger...\nYes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time.She is the deadliest of all the Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already.But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight.If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee.There is no shame in self preservation.\n\n§At the Second Church of Marika\n\nEleonora, it seems I am no match for you.But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see.I've sliced the finger off.Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer.Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire...\n\nAfter being attacked\n\n(Combat) Too late for you, eh? Well, if you've succumbed to cessblood... it's better that I finish you here.\n(On player kill) I had no choice. Your death could have been much worse.\n\nUpon defeat\n\nI must not die... until she is eradicated.\n\nElden Ring Notes & Trivia for Bloody Finger Hunter Yura\n\nIn combat, Yura wields a Nagakiba. When fighting him after he is possessed by Shabriri, he moves his sword to his left hand, and now has a Frenzied Flame Seal, using it to cast Unendurable Frenzy, Inescapable Frenzy, and Howl of Shabriri (insert other spells)\nEleonora appears to have taken part in Dragon Communion based on her armor and spells used during the invasion. This explains how Yura knows about Dragon Communion and how it works, as well as the dangers of it. \n\n If you reach the capital, you will miss An ash of war, Raptor of the mist, his armour set and the katana can be obtained later in the game even if you miss entirely his quest ( not sure about Eleonora's Poleblade)\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
