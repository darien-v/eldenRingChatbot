Adan, Thief of Fire is an evergaol prisoner found in the Malefactor's Evergaol in southern Liurnia of the Lakes. Adan is a stout battle mage wielding a spiked flail and utilizes fire magic. This is an optional boss as players are not required to defeat it to advance in Elden Ring.\n\n The monks came to the land of Liurnia in pursuit of a fugitive who stole their fire.\n\nElden Ring Adan, Thief of Fire Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss\nThis is a Tarnished enemy: its stats and attacks work like a player character with equipped items\nClosest Site of Grace: Scenic Isle\nMultiplayer is not allowed for this boss\nYou cannot summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Adan, Thief of Fire Location\nAdan, Thief of Fire is imprisoned within the Malefactor's Evergaol in southern Liurnia of the Lakes, at the peak of a cliff.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 245\nScarlet Rot: 245\nHemorrhage: 248\nFrostbite: 248\n\nSleep: 287\nMadness: 287\nDeath Blight: 203\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.

Always watch out for the telegraphs. Each fire spell he uses flashes a red circular rune briefly before they are cast, signaling when you should dodge away. His Flame of the Fell God spell has a very long animation and slow travel speed, allowing you to easily maintain a safe distance. Catch Flame, on the other hand comes out very quickly and players will need to be extra vigilant in looking for the telegraph.\nAdan's melee attacks aren't anything special, although they do apply the hemorrhage effect. His flail combo has a very long animation and Adan commits to it fully if you are just out of range. It also has low tracking. Use this to your advantage and wait just out of reach for him to whiff the combo finisher before punishing.\nHe is very easily stunned by heavy weapons, if he is stunned, follow up with 1 or 2 attacks.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nAdan poses no significant challenge for Magic and Ranged users as they can remain at a distance and avoid most of his attacks. During his Flame of the Fell God casting animation, Magic and Ranged have a huge advantage as they can pummel him with spells from afar. Do watch out for his dodge rolls, however. He uses these to close the distance and often follows up with an overhead smash. He will also end his flail combo early to dodge roll if necessary.\n\nAdan, Thief of Fire Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nFlame of the Fell God\nAdan raises his left hand, summoning an orb of fire that then travels slowly towards a destination before exploding and setting fire to the ground. Has a large radius and deals massive damage on a direct hit.\nThe attack has a very clear telegraph and long cast animation. Easily avoided by keeping your distance.\n\nCatch Flame\nAdan releases a burst of flame directly in front of him. This is usually used when in melee range.\nThe attack comes out very quickly but is telegraphed by a red circular rune. Dodge backwards or to the side when you see the rune form.\n\nOverhead Swing\nAdan swings his flail downwards, smashing directly in front of him. Often used following a dodge roll.\nDodge sideways.\n\nWild Strikes\nAdan swings his flail wildly from side to side 7 times and then finishes off with a spinning strike.\nEasily exploited. Adan does not stop once he begins this animation if you remain just out of reach. Keep your distance and consider using Impaling Thrust, or other heavy attacks, when his combo finishes.\n\nAdan, Thief of Fire Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nAccording to the spell he drops, he apparently stole the knowledge of the Flame of the Fell God incantation from Chief Guardian Arghanthy in the Mountaintops. This explains how he is able to use it in combat. The Monks chased him to the land of Liurnia, which explains their presence in the area.\n\nAdan, Thief of Fire Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
