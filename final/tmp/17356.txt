Mimic Tears are special kinds of Silver Tears that can completely mimic their opponent. They were created by the people of the Eternal Cities, and Mimic Tears in particular were created in an attempt to forge a lord. \nThis is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, doing so yields useful Items and Runes. Take note of all the Weapons and Spells you have equipped when spawning the boss in - these are the exact same weapons and spells you'll find yourself faced against. With this in mind, it's possible to unequip all your equipment and spells before the fight starts to force the Mimic Tear to fight with its bare fists. Re-equipping them during the boss fight will not re-equip them for the Mimic Tear. It drops the Silver Tear Mask or Blackflame Monk Amon Ashes when defeated.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Great Enemy bosses can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items.\nA Mimic Tear can be summoned as a spirit for aid in battle by using the Mimic Tear Ashes.\n\nThose of the Eternal City have created a special type of Silver Tear, capable of completely mimicking its opponent, along with any spells, skills and armaments they have. \n\nElden Ring Mimic Tear Boss\nMimic Tear initially spawns in as a Silver Tear, then transforms into your character, having the same equipped armor, weapons and spells to fight. \n\nMimic Tear is mandatory for at least one ending.\nStray Mimic Tear is an optional boss, no matter the ending desired.\nMimic Tear is a Great Enemy-class Boss\nClosest Site of Grace: Nokron, Eternal City. [Elden Ring Map Link]; Hidden Path to the Haligtree [Elden Ring Map Link]\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon Spirit Ashes for this boss\n\nElden Ring Mimic Tear Location\nThe Mimic Tear boss is encountered in multiple locations:\n\nMimic Tear can be found behind a mist door to a temple ruin in Nokron, Eternal City. It doesn't attack immediately, but transforms when you approach the it in the middle of the ruin. See it on the Elden Ring Map Here.\nOne is encountered as the Stray Mimic Tear in the secret catacombs under the Hidden Path to the Haligtree. See the location's page for details on how to reach the boss. Despite the slightly different name, this boss functions much the same way as the Mimic Tear. See it on the Elden Ring Map Here.\n\nMimic Tear Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG (??), NG+ (??), NG++ (8250), NG+3 (??), NG+4 (??), NG+5 (??), NG+6 (??), NG+7 (??) \n\nUnique to any other boss, Tarnished max HP affects this boss HP\n\nDamage type: It depends (same applies to Status Effects)\nWith specific equipment it can perform a parry, use equipment or Ash of War.\nCan heal 1 time\nPoise: It depends on Tarnished equipment when entering boss fight arena\nParryable: Yes/No (it depends on weapon Tarnished had equipped when entering boss fight arena)\nGuard Break: Yes/No (it depends on weapon player Tarnished equipped when entering boss fight arena)\nIs vulnerable to a critical hit after being guard broken or parried, can be backstabbed\nArmor worn during entering boss fight arena affects the boss Absorption. \n\nExample: Deaths poker dealt 161 damage to Mimic with Lionel Set (exluding armor)/Pumpkin helm and 244 to Mimic without any armor.\n\nAbsorptions:\n\nPhy (Sta): ??\nPhy (Sla): ??\nPhy (Str): ??\nPhy (Thr): ??\nMagic: ??\nFire: ??\nLightning: ??\nHoly: ??\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example if an absorption is 60. 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number= less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances:\n\nPoison: ???\nScarlet Rot: ???\nHemorrhage: ????\nFrostbite: ????\nMadness: ???\nSleep: ??? (stagger only)\nDeath Blight: ???\n\nThe resistance numbers is the buildup amount to trigger it. For example if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring Mimic Tear Boss Guide\n\nMimic Tear Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nMimic Tear Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Mimic Tear:\n\nUse the Lone Wolf Ashes Ash Summons or any Ashes if having difficulty\nKeep in mind that whatever build and equipment you choose to proceed with during this encounter will be mirrored. This will include the Armor, Weapons, Consumables, and Spells you are actively using.\nUnequip armors and weapons you have so the the Mimic will appear with nothing once you enter the arena, then after going through the yellow mist, you can start equipping your weapons and quickly make work of this boss fight.\nLike any human encounter, Status Effects are very effective.\n\nMelee Users\nStrategy: You could unequip your main weapon and catalyst/staff, the boss will have only their fists to attack you with. Then, spam your strongest poise breaking attack or backstab him for maximum damage. The Mimic Tear will then only transform when you approach close enough. If in co-op, this means you can keep a distance while another player focuses on clearing it. \nWithout this method, this fight strategy will vary since the Mimic Tear is essentially a copy of you. You will have to keep in mind what your build is and fight according to your own weakness. Any healing items will also apply to the mimic tear so be mindful when distancing yourself as well. \nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor Ranged Users, the strategy would be the same. If you're going in with Sorceries or Faith builds you can expect this boss to have the same. If you don't want to fight a boss with the same build as you, you will have to go in with a different set of equipped weapons before switching back. \nSummon/Co-Op Strategy\nThe boss only transforms when the host gets within range of the boss while it's in its slime form. Therefore, by summoning a player, it's possible to cheese the boss. Summon a player into the game, go into the boss room, and do not go near the boss. Have the summoned player attack the boss while it's in slime form. The boss will have the normal health of a Silver Tear enemy, and will be much easier to kill. This method only works if the summon can 1-shot the boss while it's in slime form, but in this phase it has much lower HP. Note: It's possible to employ a similar strategy solo by 1-shotting the boss while staying out of it's range, using magic or some other means.\n All Users (Optional)\nDo NOT  kill the Mimic Tear!: Since there are only 2 Mimic Tears in the Lands Between that don't respawn when killed and they copy all your equipment and skills, don't kill them and use them as practise, i.e. learning how to dodge or counter every Ash of War and spell in the game by not attacking and only focus on dodging it's attacks. Make sure you end your fight with the Mimic Tear by YOU dying and not the Mimic Tear. Be very wary if you have spells and/or Ashes of War that cause self-harm like Seppuku, since the Mimic Tear will eventually kill itself if the fight is prolonged.\n\nMimic Tear Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\n   Mimic Tear attacks are dependent on the player's equipped weapons and stats. They adjust accordingly to your own build. \n\nMimic Tear Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nVoice Actor: ??\nMimic Tear is a boss in a closed arena, that can die not from player direct hit (f.e. by using Seppuku Skill/Ash of War).\nOther Notes and Trivia Go Here\n\nMimic Tear Weapon Oversights\n\nThe Mimic Tear never uses the charged version of Thundercloud Form (Dragon King's Cragblade Ash of War) for some reason.\nOther oversights involving weapon and Mimic Tear relationships go here.\n\nMimic Tear Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
