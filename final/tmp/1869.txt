CONTEXT
\nBosses in Elden Ring are powerful enemies that add challenging experiences to the game. Bosses are encountered throughout the game in both the overworld and inside traditional dungeon-style levels. While some must be fought to progress through the story, most are optional. Each boss features a unique set of moves, gear, and various weaknesses and resistances to different damage types and styles of play. Successfully defeating a boss grants the player larger amounts of Runes than traditional enemies in their respective areas, and many offer rare and/or unique armaments, armor, magic, and other items. This page contains a list of all the bosses encountered in the game.\n\nSee NPC Summons for AI cooperators that can assist you in fights\nSee Remembrance Weapons (Boss Weapons) for a list of unique gear from the main bosses of the game\nSee Builds for ideas on how to optimize your character Stats.\nSee Status Effects and Damage Types to understand boss and player damage.\nSee Multiplayer to understand how summoning cooperators will affect bosses.\n\nElden Ring Main Bosses Lore\nThe Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, inhabited by Gods, monsters, mortals, and everything in between. The Elden Ring, a physical manifestation of the fundamental laws of the world, was broken and its major pieces are now held by powerful Demigods - also referred to as Shardbearers - offspring of Gods and Mortals. Each of these mighty creatures is constantly vying to collect all the shards in an effort to gain control of the full Elden Ring. These beings and their servants compose most of the main story Bosses of the game.The Demigods inherited different powers from their pieces of the Elden Ring, changing and twisting their bodies and minds as they fell into the disorder and chaos of the Ring's corrupting presence. Those blessed by the Elden Ring are often characterized with a golden aura, giving their eyes a golden glow. According to Hidetaka Miyazaki, the design philosophy of these powerful opponents was "...to depict these beings as not just creatures and horrible monsters, but have an element of heroism and an element of mythology to them."\nElden Ring Achievement Bosses\nCertain bosses in Elden Ring are not Demigods, but the game will give you an achievement for besting them.  Killing all of the achievement bosses is required for the Elden Ring achievement. The following are achievement bosses. There are currently 30 achievement bosses.\n\nMargit the Fell Omen\nGodrick the Grafted\nRed Wolf of Radagon\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon\nLeonine Misbegotten (Castle Morne)\nAncestor Spirit\nStarscourge Radahn\nMagma Wyrm Makar\nMimic Tear (Nokron, Eternal City)\nRoyal Knight Loretta\nRegal Ancestor Spirit\nDragonkin Soldier of Nokstella\nValiant Gargoyles\nAstel, Naturalborn of the Void\nGodskin Noble (Volcano Manor)\nRykard, Lord of Blasphemy\nElemer of the Briar\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)\nMorgott the Omen King\nMohg, the Omen\nCommander Niall\nFire Giant\nLoretta, Knight of the Haligtree\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella\nGodskin Duo\nDragonlord Placidusax\nMaliketh, the Black Blade\nLichdragon Fortissax\nMohg, Lord of Blood\nHoarah Loux, Warrior\n\nNOTE: Some bosses are needed to beat the game but don't give an achievement (like Draconic Tree Sentinel, Sir Gideon Ofnir, Elden Beast) so they will not be listed in the list\n\nBoss Stats\nA complete list of every boss's strengths, weaknesses, and resistances stat values.\n\n720p Version ♦ 1080p Version\n\nAll Elden Ring Bosses\nUnlike common enemies, Bosses do not respawn once defeated and can be distinguished by their health bar and name appearing at the bottom of the screen when fought against.\n\nTypes of Bosses\nThere are three types of Bosses:\n\nField Bosses are those found while exploring The Lands Between and are optional. These are in the lower tier of the Bosses hierarchy and usually generate an [Enemy Felled] screen when slain.\nGreater Enemies Bosses are found blocking progress or guarding important, powerful items and areas. They are a step higher than Field Bosses and distinguished by the message [Great Enemy Felled] when slain.\nDemigods and Legends are the main Bosses of Elden Ring. Slaying one of these mighty foes will reward the player with a Remembrance and possibly one of the seven Great Runes, which are shards of the Elden Ring. This is why they their possessors are titled, "Shardbearers".\n\nMandatory Bosses\nThe only thing preventing a player from simply ignoring every Shardbearer and walking straight into Leyndell (after defeating the Draconic Tree Sentinel boss) is a barrier that can only be removed by possessing two or more Great Runes. Therefore, while Godrick the Grafted; Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon; Starscourge Radahn; Mohg, Lord of Blood; and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy are all individually optional, two of them must be defeated to enter Leyndell.\nThe minimum number of Bosses required to reach Leyndell is three (Starscourge Radahn; Mohg, Lord of Blood; and the Draconic Tree Sentinel) because all the other Shardbearers have preceding Bosses that must be defeated first. The Draconic Tree Sentinel is technically an optional boss since it is possible to reach Leyndell with the waygate in Prince of Death's Throne in Deeproot Depths after defeating Fia's Champions; however, this waygate is inaccessible and displays the message, "You cannot use this without more Great Runes", unless a minimum of two Shardbearers have been defeated.\n"Elden Ring players have initiated 5.9 billion boss battles in the first year since launch" - Elden Ring Stats Reveal How Many Times Players Attempted Malenia\nOnce the player reaches Leyndell, they have far fewer options for skipping bosses, as the remaining areas cannot be accessed without defeating the relevant Bosses:\n\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)\nMorgott, the Omen King\nFire Giant\nGodskin Duo\nBeast Clergyman\nSir Gideon-Ofnir, the All-Knowing\nGodfrey, First Elden Lord\nRadagon of the Golden Order\n\n   Boss List by Location \n\n   Boss List by Legacy Dungeon \n\n   Boss List by Boss Type \n\nBosses by Location \n\nQuick Search of All Bosses by Location \n\nBosses in Limgrave\n\nBeastman of Farum Azula\nBell Bearing Hunter\nBlack Knife Assassin\nBloodhound Knight Darriwil\nCrucible Knight\nDeathbird\nDemi-Human Chief\nErdtree Burial Watchdog (Stormfoot Catacombs)\nFlying Dragon Agheel\nGodrick the Grafted\nGrafted Scion\nGrave Warden Duelist\nGuardian Golem\nMad Pumpkin Head\nMargit, the Fell Omen\nNight's Cavalry\nPatches\nSoldier of Godrick\nStonedigger Troll\nTibia Mariner\nTree Sentinel\nUlcerated Tree Spirit\n\nBosses in Weeping Peninsula\n\nAncient Hero of Zamor\nCemetery Shade\nDeathbird\nErdtree Avatar\nErdtree Burial Watchdog (Impaler's Catacombs)\nLeonine Misbegotten\nMiranda the Blighted Bloom\nNight's Cavalry\nRunebear\nScaly Misbegotten\n\nBosses in Liurnia of the Lakes\n\nAdan, Thief of Fire\nAlabaster Lord \nAlecto, Black Knife Ringleader\nBell Bearing Hunter\nBlack Knife Assassin\nBloodhound Knight\nBols, Carian Knight\nCemetery Shade\nCleanrot Knight\nCrystalian\nCrystalian Spear & Crystalian Staff (Duo)\nDeath Rite Bird\nDeathbird\nErdtree Avatar (Liurnia Northeast)\nErdtree Avatar (Liurnia Southwest)\nErdtree Burial Watchdog\nGlintstone Dragon Adula\nGlintstone Dragon Smarag\nMagma Wyrm Makar\nNight's Cavalry (Liurnia North)\nNight's Cavalry (Liurnia South)\nOmenkiller\nRed Wolf of Radagon\nRennala, Queen of the Full Moon\nRoyal Knight Loretta\nRoyal Revenant\nSpirit-Caller Snail\nTibia Mariner\n\nBosses in Caelid\n\nCemetery Shade\nCommander O'Neil\nCrucible Knight & Misbegotten Warrior\nDeath Rite Bird\nDecaying Ekzykes\nErdtree Avatar\nErdtree Burial Watchdog (Duo)\nFallingstar Beast\nFrenzied Duelist\nMad Pumpkin Heads\nMagma Wyrm\nNight's Cavalry (Caelid)\nNox Swordstress & Nox Priest\nStarscourge Radahn\n\nBosses in Dragonbarrow\n\nBattlemage Hugues\nBeastman of Farum Azula (Duo)\nBell Bearing Hunter\nBlack Blade Kindred \nCleanrot Knight (Duo)\nElder Dragon Greyoll\nFlying Dragon Greyll\nGodskin Apostle\nNight's Cavalry (Dragonbarrow)\nPutrid Avatar\nPutrid Crystalian Trio\nPutrid Tree Spirit\n\nBosses in Altus Plateau\n\nAncient Dragon Lansseax\nAncient Hero of Zamor\nBlack Knife Assassin (Sage's Cave)\nBlack Knife Assassin (Sainted Hero's Grave)\nCrystalian Spear & Crystalian Ringblade\nDemi-Human Queen Gilika\nElemer of the Briar\nErdtree Burial Watchdog\nFallingstar Beast\nGodefroy The Grafted\nGodskin Apostle\nNecromancer Garris\nNight's Cavalry\nOmenkiller & Miranda the Blighted Bloom\nPerfumer Tricia & Misbegotten Warrior\nSanguine Noble\nStonedigger Troll\nTibia Mariner\nTree Sentinel (Duo)\nWormface\n\nBosses in Mt.
