Misbegotten Crusader is a variation of the Leonine Misbegotten Boss, wielding the Golden Order Greatsword, and is found in Cave of the Forlorn in Mountaintops of the Giants. This is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, doing so yields useful Items and Runes.\nLesser Misbegotten Warrior is the normal enemy form of this boss. Other variants of this boss appear in the Leonine Misbegotten, Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior, and Perfumer Tricia and Misbegotten Warrior boss fights.\nElden Ring Misbegotten Crusader Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss, but it must be defeated in order to receive the Legendary Armaments trophy\nClosest Site of Grace: Cave of the Forlorn\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Misbegotten Crusader Location\nThe end boss of the Cave of the Forlorn. [Map Link]\nMisbegotten Crusader Combat information\n\nHealth: 9,130 HP \nDefense: 120\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nIs vulnerable to a  critical hit  after being stance broken or parried\nDamage: Standard, Pierce, Holy\nDrops 93,000, Golden Order Greatsword\n\nNegations (or Absorptions)\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 0\nStrike: 10\nPierce: 10\n\nMagic: 20\nFire: 0\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe negation numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 means the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 367 / 465 / 755 / 1212\nScarlet Rot: 367 / 465 / 755 / 1212\nHemorrhage: 367 / 465 / 755 / 1212\nFrostbite: 367 / 465 / 755 / 1212\n\nSleep: 367 / 465 / 755 / 1212\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.

While it is performing an attack, however, it gains massive hyper-armor and can breeze through the heaviest hits and connect.\n\nMelee Users\nThis boss may look like any other Misbegotten boss and has a moveset similar to the Leonine Misbegotten, but it deals greater damage with additional Holy damage and with its attacks using the Golden Order Greatsword. It does a number of fast-moving aggressive attacks while advancing towards you. If you have a shield use it against these combo attacks while backing up. It will be even better if you have a shield that could defend against holy damage. When you have a chance, towards the end of the attack combos, roll through and toward the boss in order to deal a few hits. Use a combination of rolling in and attacking during the small windows, then immediately backing up again. You will especially have to look for its large AoE attacks which can occur within combo attacks. The main strategy here is to keep a defensive stance while preparing to dodge away and then quickly approach during each opening. Be conservative with your attacks until the boss is defeated.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nWith a magic build, you may want to use quick-moving spells such as Glintstone Pebble or Glinstone Stars. Keep in mind that when you create distance, this boss quickly can close that distance with his quick lunges and could reach you with its holy ranged attacks. You will have to keep moving and constantly be prepared to dodge to the side. Attack sparingly and in between its attacks to avoid being unprepared for an incoming attack. \n\nMisbegotten Crusader Attacks & Counters\nSee the Leonine Misbegotten page for a more complete and detailed guide on its moveset, as it shares most of the same attacks.\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nEstablish Order\nStands up straight and raises its arms to the right, releasing a holy explosion.

Since Misbegotten are widely regarded as heretical, this one may be fighting to protect them.\nThis Misbegotten wields the Golden Order Greatsword, which was forged by King Consort Radagon. It was originally a sword gifted to him by his first wife, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon.\nIn the Japanese version of the game, internal files relating to the Misbegotten are named “Children of Radagon”. In the English version of the game (patch 1.00), the Winged Misbegotten was called a “Radagon chimera.” This may explain why Misbegotten Warriors have red hair like Radagon and how one managed to obtain the Golden Order Greatsword.\n\nMisbegotten Crusader Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n

QUESTION
How can players effectively defeat the Misbegotten Crusader boss in Elden Ring's Cave of the Forlorn location?

ANSWER
Players can effectively defeat the Misbegotten Crusader boss by using fast rush down Ashes, defensive shielding, and rolling in for attacks during openings, especially against its combo and AoE attacks, while magic users should employ quick-moving spells and dodge its lunges and ranged attacks, attacking sparingly in between.
