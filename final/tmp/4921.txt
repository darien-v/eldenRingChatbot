CONTEXT
\n\n Teardrop Scarabs \n\nCerulean Scarab: Restores Flask of Crimson Tears\n\nCrimson Scarab: Restores Flask of Cerulean Tears\n\nTeardrop Scarabs are special creatures in Elden Ring. Similar to Crystal Lizards in the Souls series, Teardrop Scarabs are non-hostile creatures that drop valuable items upon defeat. If the player fails to quickly eliminate them, they will begin to flicker and then disappear from the area.\n\n These scarabs often roll clumps of valuable ashes of war during their labors, along with crimson and cerulean tears. They are very skittish, and will often flee when spotted.\n\nStrategies for Teardrop Scarab in Elden Ring\nUnlike Crystal Lizards, Teardrop Scarabs don't have particularly high resistances, so it's possible to defeat them easily with both magic and physical damage. Players should be careful, however, as the scarabs often run into groups of larger enemies, making them harder to target and making the player the victim of plenty of ambushes. For this reason, ranged attacks are usually best.\n\nRed and Blue Scarabs respawn when you rest. They are used to refill both flasks when killed.\nScarabs that roll regular balls will often drop various rare items, such as Ashes of War or Somber Smithing Stones. These do not respawn after they die.\n\nTeardrop Scarab Locations and Drops in Elden Ring\nPlayers can encounter the following Teardrop Scarabs:\n\nLimgrave\n\nChurch of Dragon Communion (south of island) - Drops Somber Smithing Stone [1]\nLimgrave: north-East from the Church of Elleh, behind a broken building with Ruin Fragments, on the way to Gatefront Ruins - Drops "??"\nLimgrave: Western beach.

When hit, falls and acts like a regular Teardrop Scarab. Fall can damage player (very low damage).\nInvisible - Low-health variation (die to 1 hit), that can be seen thanks to their visible steps, plus they follow one route. Sorcerers can use spells with AoE or sorceries like Glintblade Phalanx, which target invisible enemies. Melee user can utilize either bow or Ashes of War with AoE like Ground Slam.\nEnlarging - Enlarge after receiving a specific amount of damage. Becomes larger than player and can pose some threat, however their behaviour remains unchanged. \nEscaping - When it spots a player, it will teleport a short distance away. Sneaking is an option, but bows are more effective.\nExplosive - Regular scarab, but their balls explodes after few seconds. Explosion is telegraphed, plus it does not happen if scarab dies due to gravity.\n\nCerulean and Crimson Scarabs roll around a ball that appears to be a bunch of twigs together with a glowing center. Special Scarabs will have regular balls filled with rocks and such.\n\nElden Ring Teardrop Scarab Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Creatures & Enemies\n\nAbductor Virgin  ♦  Abnormal Stone Cluster  ♦  Albinauric  ♦  Albinauric Wolfback Archer  ♦  Anastasia Tarnished-Eater  ♦  Ancestral Follower  ♦  Ancestral Follower Shaman  ♦  Avionette Soldier  ♦  Azula Beastman  ♦  Baleful Shadow  ♦  Banished Knight  ♦  Basilisk  ♦  Battlemage  ♦  Bear  ♦  Blackflame Monk  ♦  Bloody Finger Nerijus  ♦  Bloody Finger Ravenmount Assassin  ♦  Boar  ♦  Broken Statue  ♦  Burning Slug  ♦  Celebrant  ♦  Chanting Winged Dame  ♦  Chariot  ♦  Chief Guardian Arghanthy  ♦  Clayman  ♦  Colossal Fingercreeper  ♦  Commoner  ♦  Construct  ♦  Crab  ♦  Crystal Snail  ♦  Crystal Sorcerer  ♦  Deer  ♦  Demi-Human  ♦  Demi-Human Queen  ♦  Depraved Perfumer  ♦  Direwolf  ♦  Dog  ♦  Duelist  ♦  Eagle  ♦  Edgar the Revenger  ♦  Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm  ♦  Exile Soldier  ♦  Fallen Hawks Soldier  ♦  Farum Azula Dragon  ♦  Festering Fingerprint Vyke  ♦  Fingercreeper  ♦  Fire Monk  ♦  Fire Prelate  ♦  Flame Guardian  ♦  Frenzied Villager  ♦  Giant Ant  ♦  Giant Bat  ♦  Giant Crab  ♦  Giant Crayfish  ♦  Giant Dog  ♦  Giant Dragonfly  ♦  Giant Land Octopus  ♦  Giant Land Squirt  ♦  Giant Miranda Sprout  ♦  Giant Rat  ♦  Giant Skeletal Slime  ♦  Giant Skeleton (Spirit)  ♦  Glintstone Dragon  ♦  Glintstone Sorcerer  ♦  Godrick Foot Soldier  ♦  Golem  ♦  Great Horned Tragoth  ♦  Great-Jar Warrior  ♦  Guardian  ♦  Guillemot  ♦  Haligtree Foot Soldier  ♦  Haligtree Knight  ♦  Haligtree Soldier  ♦  High Page  ♦  Highwayman  ♦  Inaba, Disciple of Okina  ♦  Inquisitor Ghiza  ♦  Juno Hoslow, Knight of Blood  ♦  Kaiden Sellsword  ♦  Knight of Zamor  ♦  Land Octopus  ♦  Land Squirt  ♦  Lazuli Sorcerer  ♦  Lesser Alabaster Lord  ♦  Lesser Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Lesser Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Lesser Burial Watchdog  ♦  Lesser Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Lesser Dragonkin Soldier (Spirit)  ♦  Lesser Fingercreeper  ♦  Lesser Kindred of Rot (Pests)  ♦  Lesser Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Lesser Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Lesser Omenkiller  ♦  Lesser Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Lesser Runebear  ♦  Lesser Sanguine Noble  ♦  Lesser Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Lesser Wormface  ♦  Leyndell Foot Soldier  ♦  Leyndell Knight  ♦  Leyndell Soldier  ♦  Lion Guardian  ♦  Living Jar  ♦  Lone Wolf  ♦  Mad Tongue Alberich  ♦  Maleigh Marais, Shaded Castle Castellan  ♦  Malformed Star  ♦  Man-Serpent  ♦  Mausoleum Foot Soldier  ♦  Mausoleum Knight  ♦  Mausoleum Soldier  ♦  Miner  ♦  Miranda Sprout  ♦  Misbegotten  ♦  Monstrous Crow  ♦  Mounted Knight  ♦  Nameless White Mask  ♦  Night Maiden  ♦  Noble Sorcerer  ♦  Nomad  ♦  Nox Monk  ♦  Nox Swordstress  ♦  Old Knight Istvan  ♦  Omen  ♦  Oracle Envoy  ♦  Oracle Envoy Giant  ♦  Owl  ♦  Page  ♦  Preceptor Miriam  ♦  Putrid Avatar  ♦  Putrid Corpse  ♦  Radahn Foot Soldier  ♦  Radahn Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Foot Soldier  ♦  Raya Lucaria Knight  ♦  Raya Lucaria Soldier  ♦  Recusant Henricus  ♦  Redmane Knight  ♦  Revenant  ♦  Rileigh the Idle  ♦  Rotten Duelist  ♦  Scarlet Rot Zombie  ♦  School of Graven Mages  ♦  Serpent Snail  ♦  Servant of Rot  ♦  Sheep  ♦  Silver Tear  ♦  Skeletal Bandit  ♦  Skeletal Militiaman  ♦  Skeletal Slime  ♦  Skeletal Snail  ♦  Skeleton Mage  ♦  Skeletons  ♦  Slug  ♦  Soldier  ♦  Spirit Jellyfish  ♦  Spirit NPC  ♦  Springhare  ♦  Starcaller  ♦  Tanith's Knight  ♦  Thorn Sorcerer  ♦  Troll  ♦  Troll Knight  ♦  Turtle  ♦  Twinsage Sorcerer  ♦  Unobtainable Items  ♦  Vargram the Raging Wolf  ♦  Vulgar Militant  ♦  Wandering Nobles  ♦  Warhawk  ♦  Wild Mouflon  ♦  Wraith Caller\n\n
