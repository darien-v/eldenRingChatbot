For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 539 / 829 / 1286\nScarlet Rot: 539 / 829 / 1286\nHemorrhage: 239 / 281 / 379 / 669\nFrostbite: 239 / 281 / 379 / 669\n\nSleep: 179 / 207 / 249 / 347\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it.

First fall off the ramp side and aggro the dog near the house. After it dies, the second dog should aggro. The final dog is behind the tree to the left of the boss. Stand on the large root near the house and take it out with arrows.\nBring Stanching Boluses Item to account for Hemorrhage build up.\n\nMelee Users\nThe most challenging part of the Omenkiller fight is the environment. Omenkiller does a double slam jump attack three times in a row, that will likelu one-shot light armor wearers, combo medium armor wearers in 2 hits, and instantly stagger all but the strongest shields. If you get caught on some of the junk lying around, you will die. So take some time to really look at the area. You will want to wear enough armor to survive at least one of his double slam jump attacks, while keeping in the medium load range.\nDefensively, simply backing up is enough to avoid almost all of his attacks - as long as you don't get caught on the environment. The only one to watch out for is his jump attacks. You can back away from them, and the timing for rolls is not too difficult, but getting tagged by the first or second attack of the combo is usually death. The third attack in the combo has a deceptively long range as well, so be sure and have your shield up even if you think you won't get hit.\nOmenkiller uses the fire defensively, so it's fairly easy to back away from. But you should try to push around the outside of the burning patch, because you don't want to get trapped from backing up, and being at mid range can trigger his jump attack.\nOmenkiller has relatively low poise, use your strong attack and it should interrupt him. If your weapon's strong attack does not interrupt him, you should try a heavier weapon. Because of this, he is highly susceptible to guard counters, but it's recommended that you back out of the first swing and let the second hit your shield for the counter. Be sure and watch your Hemorrhage meter though, and equip some bleed preventative tools if it builds too fast for you to manage.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nRanged is similar to melee. If you can equip a shield and weapon heavy enough to interrupt Omenkiller with a strong attack, you might find it easier to just fight him in melee. However, note that being near him is dangerous because his blade hits deal a lot of damage and may inflict Hemorrhage.  \n\nOmenkiller Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSwing\nSwings one of its cleavers in various directions\nRoll away or use the attack's telegraphed wind-up to parry it\n\nJumping Slam\nLeaps forward and slams both blades to the ground\nRoll to either side for each jump, and be careful not to get caught on the level geometry. It takes a long time to recover after the third jump, so use that opportunity to or land a few hits or get a backstab\n\nTwirling Swing\nSwings both cleavers clockwise as it turns 180°. Used when you're behind it\nRoll to your right or parry the first cleaver\n\nFire Breath\nBreathes fire that lingers on the ground for a short time\nMove back and avoid the burning patch of ground. This is a good opportunity to use items or cast spells\n\n: Attack can be parried\nOmenkiller Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nAccording to Omenkiller Rollo, they often used perfumes to null their senses, allowing them to kill without remorse or emotion.\nKnown as Forsaken in 1.00 version of the game\nA very obvious nod to the Capra Demon, which include many of the same attacks, along with canine companions.\n\nOmenkiller Combo Chart\n\nOmenkiller Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
