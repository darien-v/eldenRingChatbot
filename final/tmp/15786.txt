CONTEXT
\nNPC Invaders in Elden Ring are hostile NPCs or human Enemies that could appear once players reach specific locations. If an NPC invader is close, players will receive a prompt stating who they are invaded by. If they are riding on horseback, Torrent will despawn. Upon their defeat the game notifies players with the prompt, Invader Vanquished. It is also possible to be invaded by some familiar ally NPCs. On the other hand, it is also possible to have a sign available for you invade specific NPCs as well. Upon defeat, this will instead inform the player that the host has be vanquished.
