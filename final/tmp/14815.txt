Gurranq appears to be a large, hunched creature that lies isolated in the Bestial Sanctum. Constantly hungering for Deathroot, he will reward those who offer it to him.\n\n I won't forget... again... mine appetite... My sin...\n\nGurranq, Beast Clergyman Location in Elden Ring\nGurranq, Beast Clergyman can be found at the Bestial Sanctum in Dragonbarrow. [Map link]This location can be accessed via a waygate in Limgrave [Map link]\n\nThis NPC does not move.\nGurranq can be fought and killed\nIf defeated, drops: Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nDialogue will not advance after the fourth deathroot unless you walk away or rest to trigger an event. \n\nThe event must be triggered before dialogue continues if giving a single root at a time.\nMultiple deathroots at a time, or continuing before event trigger, skips lore dialogue.\nAll rewards will be given after event resolution, if given more than one at a time.\n\nElden Ring Gurranq, Beast Clergyman Shop\n\nItem Name\nItem Type\nDeathroot\n\nClawmark Seal and Beast Eye\nSacred Seal\nFirst\n\nBestial Sling\nIncantation\nSecond\n\nBestial Vitality \nIncantation\nThird\n\nAsh of War: Beast's Roar \nAshes of War\nFourth(Event Trigger: Aggression)\n\nBeast Claw\nIncantation\nFifth\n\nStone of Gurranq\nIncantation\nSixth\n\nBeastclaw Greathammer\nWarhammer\nSeventh\n\nGurranq's Beast Claw\nIncantation\nEighth\n\nAncient Dragon Smithing Stone\nEquipment Upgrade\nNinth\n\nGurranq Beast Clergyman Questline\nPlayers should go to Summonwater Village and defeat the Tibia Mariner there, then return to D at the Roundtable Hold to continue his quest. He will give you directions to go to the Bestial Sanctum in Caelid. You can teleport straight there without having to explore by using the waygate in East Limgrave. [Map link]Be wary of the enemies, as they are much stronger due to being in a higher level area.\nAfter the fourth Deathroot, he will become hostile towards you, you will have to bring his HP down until he stops attacking, then you can speak with him, reset the area, and use the fifth Deathroot for the Beast Claw Incantation. If you gave Gurranq the fifth Deathroot before he went aggressive, he will immediately give you the Beast Claw Incantation upon speaking to him after subduing him.\nYou can also choose to not talk to him after he stops attacking and kill him instead. This will make him drop the Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone without completing his quest.\n\nA tip for those who are finding this difficult: if you can aggro and bait the Black Blade Kindred just outside to use its sword wave attack, it can deal enough damage to de-aggro Gurranq.\nYou can also bait him at the entrance (he can hit you through the gates and walls), back away far enough and use Night Maiden's Mist (charged for extra radius) to slowly whittle down his HP. Do note that he will remain aggressive until you reset the area.\nIf you have a summon that can inflict rot or poison, such as a Rotten Stray Ashes or Spirit Jellyfish Ashes, you can poison Gurranq and wait outside while the damage ticks. It will eventually reach the threshold to break the Beast Clergyman out of his rage and return him to normal. Teleport out and back to find him in his normal spot. (If he isn't there, check to the east of the Bestial Sanctum)\nFrost is another easy option. Two frost pots should proc it and immediately calm him down.\n\nElden Ring Gurranq, Beast Clergyman information\n\nHealth: 10,620 HP\nPoise: 80\n\nAbsorptions\n\nPhy (Standard): 35\nPhy (Slash): 35\nPhy (Strike): 35\nPhy (Pierce): 35\n\nMagic: 40\nFire: 40\nLightning: 40\nHoly: 80\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example, if an absorption is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number = less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 means the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 351\nScarlet Rot: 351\nHemorrhage: 574\nFrostbite: 574\n\nSleep: Immune\nMadness: Immune\nDeath Blight: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Gurranq, Beast Clergyman\nIntroduction\n\n"..." (grunting, snarling)\n\nFirst Deathroot\n\n"...I smell it... Death... Feed it me..."\n"Tarnished... bring more... Death. I shall grant thee... eye... and claw.

Bring more."\n\n (if you feed the fifth Deathroot before you rest or leave to trigger him going aggressive, you get this message)\n\n"..."\n"More... I am not... sated... Feed me more... Death"\n\nUpon dealing enough damage after feeding the fourth Deathroot\n\n"Put it away. I won't forget... again... mine appetite... My sin... So please.... Enough."\n\nFifth Deathroot\n\n"My thanks Tarnished.... Death... My sin... Should not be touched by the hand of man... I shall grant thee... my claws...

"Will things... never be the same... again?" \n"..." \n"Tarnished... my thanks... for thy... long labor. But I have done... all I can... in this land. Henceforth, mine appetite shall be my sole companion. Farewell."\n\nSmall talk\n\n"..."\n\nOther\n\n"More...

Why...shatter...\n\nElden Ring Gurranq, Beast Clergyman Notes & Trivia\n\nLong ago, Gurranq was a beast of such terrifying ferocity that his former name meant "Death of the Demigods."\nAt night, Gurranq can be found to the right side of the sanctum, howling at the sky. Talking to him when he does this does not grant new dialogue. \nA total of nine Deathroot can be given to him to finish his questline.  \n\nOnce all nine Deathroot have been given to him, he will tell the player that, despite their hard work, his hunger is still not satiated and that he will go on hunt them down alone. He will then vanish, giving the player an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nAlternatively, once you have given him the eighth Deathroot, you can kill him instead for the Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone, allowing you to skip the ninth Deathroot.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
