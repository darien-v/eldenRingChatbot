CONTEXT
\nDodging is a Combat mechanic in Elden Ring. It allows you to evade enemies' attacks or even pass through them without getting hurt. Dodging will be one of your main reactions or maneuvers to any incoming attacks in Elden Ring since there is a larger window for it that some other combat reactions and can be regularly done. Dodging encompasses all types of evasive maneuvers to avoid an incoming attack. Players new to the Combat system in the game can likely go through a whole encounter against the large Bosses or opponents by dodging through each attack and waiting for an attack opening. Dodging also allows players to gain a better position for a successful attack. A more advanced maneuver with a smaller window of opportunity is Parrying which grants players the opportunity to deal a Critical Hit. Below are all the basic tips, tricks, information related equipment and skills on Dodging in Elden Ring.\nDodging in Elden Ring\n\nDodge Basics Elden Ring\n\nBackstep\n⭘\nB\nSpace\n\nRoll\nMove + ⭘\nMove + B\nMove + Space\n\nRolling is the most common way to dodge, since it allows you to cover a fair amount of distance in the direction of your choice. Not only that, it gives you a large number of invulnerability frames, also called "i-frames". During these frames, you can't be damaged by incoming attacks—they'll just pass harmlessly through you. Making good use of i-frames is crucial to getting comfortable with combat in Elden Ring.\nBackstepping is less common, because it covers less ground than simply rolling backwards and doesn't provide any i-frames. However, it's much quicker and can be followed up with a Lunge Attack, so it's worth keeping in mind.\nDodge Details Elden Ring\nThe precise details of your dodge roll and backstep depend on your Equip Load. (All frame data below is for 30 FPS.)\n\nWeight Ratio\nRoll\nBackstep Recovery\n\nI-Frames\nRecovery\n\n≤ 29.9%\n13\n8\nFast\n\n30.0% - 69.9%\n13\n8\nMedium\n\n70.0% - 99.9%\n12\n16\nSlow\n\n≥ 100.0%\nCannot roll or backstep\n\nSee also Recovery Frames and Dodge Distance below.\nHow to Dodge Better in Elden Ring?\n\nThere are also a couple items that add additional i-frames after the normal ones. These don't stack with one another, nor do they apply to dodge skills.\n\nCrucible Feather Talisman: +3 i-frames, -3 recovery frames\nWindy Crystal Tear: +3 i-frames, -3 recovery frames\nYour Equipment Load also affects the speed of your dodging with heavier load at 70-100% full capacity being the slowest reaction time. \nHaving less equipment will also mean that you drain less stamina, which allows more dodging. \nDodging and gives you time while avoiding damage until you see an opportunity to begin your offensive actions.\nHave your new position in mind since dodging will reposition your character. You can even dodge while approaching to get in range for your next melee attack. When you are close enough, you can roll forward through an attack to get you in an optimum position for a backstab. \n\nEffective Dodging Elden Ring Tips\n\nDodging is a powerful tool, but it can take practice to get the most you can out of it. Here are some tips to get the most out of your dodges:\n\nRoll In: When you're in danger, it's always tempting to dodge away from the enemy. After all, you're dodging to avoid danger and the enemy is the source of that danger! But it's often better to dodge towards the enemy instead. Not only will this put you in position to land a few attacks, it'll often naturally avoid follow-up moves that are intended to punish people who roll away.\nRoll Through: It may seem counterintuitive, but when you see an attack incoming it's usually best to roll into the attack (in other words, roll in the opposite direction of the attack's movement). The attack won't hurt you as long as you have i-frames for every frame you intersect with its hitbox, so you want to overlap with it for as few frames as possible to ensure that it's not still touching you once your i-frames expire.\nBe Patient: Many bosses in Elden Ring wait just long enough to let their attacks fly that, if you roll when you first see them winding up, the attack will actually land when you're out of i-frames. This is known as "roll catching", and it's there to teach you patience. Don't roll just because you feel threatened, roll when you actually see an attack flying down towards you.\nBorn to Run: Once you're comfortable dodging, you might want to use it for all your get-out-of-danger needs. But don't forget that you can hold the button to run as well! Although running doesn't give you any i-frames, it's faster and consumes much less stamina than repeated dodges. Once you're out of an enemy's range, running is a much more effective way to put distance between you than dodging.\n\nJump Dodging Elden Ring\nYou can also dodge some attacks by jumping over them.\n\nJump\n✖\nA\nF\n\nJumping only gives you partial i-frames: you're invulnerable from the waist down, but your head, chest, arms, and even hands can still be hit by attacks. This makes it useful specifically for dodging attacks that slash horizontally or erupt from the ground. In exchange for only giving you partial invulnerability, this invulnerability lasts much longer, covering 25 frames of the jump animation with only 5 frames of recovery afterwards (at 30 FPS).\nOther I-Frames Elden Ring\nVarious other actions you can perform provide i-frames as well. While these won't be your primary means of dodging, they can be very useful in a pinch.\n\nOpening doors and chests.\nActivating switches.\nMounting and dismounting Torrent.\nParrying an attack.\nPerforming a critical hit.\n\nHow do you Dodge Effectively Elden Ring?\nNow that all the different types of dodging, and i-frames have been laid out, this needs to be applied against some Boss. Elden Ring is a game where you are encouraged to improve your combat abilities and familiarize yourself with each maneuver in order to face the numerous Bosses and enemies in the game. Get an idea of which attacks you are able to roll through. Especially since this is not the common reaction, it is important to know when to roll forward and away since tolling forward and through attacks would benefit your character by repositioning them closer to the opponent and potentially opening an opportunity for your next attack. As stated above, when you roll through, the attack won't hurt you as long as you have i-frames for every frame you intersect with its hitbox, so you want to overlap with it for as few frames as possible to ensure that it's not still touching you once your i-frames expire, which means you also have to consider your weight load. Start light so you have the quickest movements possible if you want to focus on effective dodging. This will be one of your main maneuvers to get out of pesky corners and different ranges of attacks against the Bosses. You will need to rely on your evasive capabilities in between your offensive counters or otherwise risk taking in big hits to your HP levels.\n\nDodge Skills Elden Ring\nSeveral Skills found throughout the Lands Between provide alternate ways to dodge, at the cost of a modest amount of FP.\n\nFP indicates how much FP is consumed when you use the skill.\nDelay measures how many frames (at 30FPS) elapse between pressing the skill button and becoming invulnerable. Lower is better.\nI-Frames measures how many frames (at 30FPS) you are invulnerable to damage after the delay. Higher is better.\nRecovery measures how many frames (at 30FPS) elapse after the i-frames end but before you're able to roll again. See also Recovery Frames below. Lower is better.\n\nName\nFP \nDelay\nI-Frames\nRecovery\nDescription\n\n Quickstep \n3\n0\n15*\n6 - 12\nDash in a direction, or circle around a locked-on enemy.\n\n Bloodhound's Step \n5\n0\n16*\n5 - 11\nDash a long way very quickly in one direction. Repeated Bloodhound's Steps are the fastest way to move on foot.\n\n Vow of the Indomitable \n20\n4\n30\n1\nA standing dodge that grants the longest continuous i-frames in the game, as well as a very short recovery window.\n\n Raptor of the Mists \n6\n0\n-\n-\nUnlike other dodge skills, this doesn't grant you i-frames. Instead, it automatically dodges the next single attack that would hit you.\n\n Bloodhound's Finesse \n12\n58\n20\n25\nAfter using the skill, press Heavy Attack to dash forward for a follow-up attack. You're invincible only during this dash, but when used effectively it can dodge through incoming attacks.\n\n Dynast's Finesse \n5\n0\n20\n9\nThe first activation dodges backwards, which you can then follow up with one or two additional attacks.\n\n*: If you use Quickstep and Bloodhound Step multiple times in a row, uses after the first have 2 fewer i-frames (unless you're using Quickstep and you have a light Equip Load, in which case it's only 1 fewer). Also, if you're out of FP, they only ever have 5 i-frames.\nRecovery Frames Elden Ring\nDifferent actions take more or less time to perform after a dodge, and sometimes even depend on which direction you dodge in or your Equip Load.\n\nName\nRoll\nSkill\nAttack\nGuard\nQuick Item\nItem\nWalk\n\nRight\nLeft\n\nRoll\nLight\n8\n6\n5\n6\n12\n6\n7\n9\n\nMedium\n8\n7\n7\n7\n12\n7\n8\n9\n\nHeavy\n16\n11\n11\n11\n14\n15\n15\n18\n\nQuickstep\nForward\n10\n7\n2\n6\n10\n7\n12\n14 \n\nBack\n8\n6\n1\n6\n9\n6\n10\n12\n\nSide\n7\n6\n1\n5\n8\n7\n11\n10\n\nQuickstep(Repeated)\nForward\n12\n9\n4\n6\n12\n9\n14\n16\n\nBack\n10\n8\n3\n5\n11\n8\n12\n14\n\nSide\n7\n6\n1\n5\n8\n7\n11\n10\n\nQuickstep(Repeated, Light Load)\nForward\n12\n9\n4\n6\n12\n9\n14\n16\n\nBack\n8\n6\n2\n3\n9\n6\n10\n12\n\nSide\n9\n8\n3\n5\n10\n9\n13\n12\n\nBloodhound Step\nForward\n9\n7\n1\n5\n8\n6\n11\n13\n\nBack\n7\n7\n1\n5\n8\n5\n9\n11\n\nSide\n6\n6\n1\n5\n7\n6\n10\n11\n\nBloodhound Step(Repeated)\nForward\n11\n11\n6\n7\n12\n8\n13\n15\n\nBack\n9\n11\n2\n7\n12\n7\n11\n13\n\nSide\n8\n13\n2\n6\n11\n8\n12\n13\n\nVow of the Indomitable\n1\n10\n1\n1\n1\n1\n5\n10\n\nBloodhound's Finesse\n25\n-\n30\n34\n36\n29\n34\n39\n\nDynast's Finesse\n14\n9\n19\n22\n22\n20\n22\n23\n\nDodge Distance Elden Ring\nDifferent dodges can also cover more ground, allowing you to more easily get out of the way of incoming attacks.
