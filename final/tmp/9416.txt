The Ruins Greatsword scales primarily with Strength and Intelligence and is a good Weapon for its additional magic damage. \n\nOriginally rubble from a ruin which fell from the sky, this surviving fragment was honed into a weapon.One of the legendary armaments.\nThe ruin it came from crumbled when struck by a meteorite, as such this weapon harbors its destructive power.\n\nWhere to Find Ruins Greatsword in Elden Ring\nThe Ruins Greatsword weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nRuins Greatsword can be acquried by defeating Misbegotten Warrior + Crucible Knight at Redmane Castle Plaza. [Elden Ring Map here] This boss fight is only accessible before the festival OR after defeating Starscourge Radahn and exhausting Witch-Hunter Jerren's subsequent dialogue.

There are minor increases in damage from STR levels, and the least increase from INT levels.\nCharged strong attacks cause a small burst of gravity magic upon slamming the ground. This slam causes additional damage, as well as staggering enemies in close proximity. This doesn't cost FP, but consumes more Stamina than normal charged heavy attacks.\nAt 80 Strength and 18 Intelligence, the Ruins Greatsword has 922 Attack Rating.\nIf the player doesn't meet the stat requirements to wield the weapon, the following penalties are applied:\n\nThey will become unable to use the Weapon Skill.\nTheir stamina cost on each attack is increased.\nThey cannot benefit from the weapon's magic scaling.\nHowever, meeting the STR requirement allows the physical damage and scaling of the weapon remain the same. The base magical damage also remains unaffected.\n\nThis could prove useful for pure Strength builds if the player manages to acquire it early in the game, provided they can find the Somber Stones to upgrade it.\n\nSell Value:   1000\nNormally you can rotate to attack in any which direction during the final stages of the animation but with this weapon the 1H R2 is seemingly locked into whatever direction you were facing when pressing R2.
