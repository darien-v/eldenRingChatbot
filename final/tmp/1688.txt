Draconic Tree Sentinel is a massive knight clad in golden armor that rides a massive horse and wields draconic magic.\nTree Sentinel is another version of this boss.\n\n After the great ancient dragon Gransax attacked, the sentinels had an epiphany. The only way to truly protect the Erdtree was to become dragons themselves.\n\nElden Ring Draconic Tree Sentinel Locations\n\nCapital Outskirts [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\nCrumbling Farum Azula [More Info ↓] [Map Link]\n\nDraconic Tree Sentinel Combat information\n\nStance: 80\nParryable: Yes\nImmune to critical attacks.

They can provide decent damage and can take aggro away from you.\nUse the Rotten Breath Spell for an easy kill.\nBring Rot or Poison Grease.\nErdtree Greatshield or Carian Retaliation can parry the horse's fireballs.\nIf it's charging its shield for its lightning strike, roll the moment you see it pull the shield down.\n\nAs a general overview, Scarlet Rot is the best way to take down this boss, but if that's not accessible then Poison is second best and also strong. There is an easy cheese method to take him down that is 100% reliable and poses no risk. The cheese method is at the bottom.\nGodrick's Great Rune coupled with a Rune Arc can help you survive some one hit skills, such as the fireball or Shield Lightning skills.\nIts AI is notorious for shooting fireballs whenever you are at medium-to-long range from it, and it's fond of using this attack as a heal-punish. If you remain at even medium distance from it, it's not unusual for this enemy to use this attack in quick succession until you get close enough for any of its melee attacks. If you need to heal, goad it into launching a fireball, dodge to the side, then heal. You will have just enough time to roll out of the way if it responds to your heal with a second fireball.\nMelee Users\nAs of patch 1.03, Great Horned Tragoth is available to summon for this fight. There are no triggers and he's available from level 1. This summon does ease the difficulty but it's by no means a walk in the park. Survival is the foremost priority. At least 20 Vigor, the Knight Armor, Boltdrake, and Dragoncrest Shield talismans should prevent all one-shots and allow for flask use. Alternatively, have at least 20 Endurance and block his physical damage with any 100% physical resistant shield, using Pickled Turtle Neck for stamina.\nThe key tactic of this fight is staying on the Sentinel's left side (your right) with the shield holding hand. While on his left, he attacks with a slower shield bash that's easier to dodge, does less damage, and allows room to counter attack. When his horse rears back, either for a fireball or stomp, is the best opportunity to roll to his left side. If using Tragoth, simply pause long enough for Tragoth to strike, this shifts his focus and you can safely flank the left/rear side.\nAnother tactic is using attacks which stagger and break his poise. Hammers can break the sentinel's poise in 3-4 charged heavy attacks, and with Tragoth it's easier to perform. Jumping strong attacks will also cause more stagger and are necessary as the sentinel repeatedly leaps away and repositions throughout the fight. If your HP and defense are sufficient, equipping the Claw Talisman and Raptor's Feathers increase the damage of jumping attacks.\nA weakness of the sentinel that's exploitable is his low resistance to DoT (damage over time) from scarlet rot/poison. Most melee builds will not have access to scarlet rot crafting upon reaching Leyndell. However, Poison Grease and Poisonbone Dart are powerful and accessible early on. Apply the first grease at a distance, then sprint in for 2 heavy attacks before his first swing. Apply the second grease when he changes phases. Keep in mind the rot/poison resistance goes up after the first effect, so additional poisons take more hits. It may be better to use darts for the second application as they can be thrown quickly.\nIf you can keep his aggro focused on you/Tragoth, ranged summons will do more damage than melee summons which tend to die quickly. Because of it's ranged attacks and poison stacks, Spirit Jellyfish Ashes may be the best low-level choice since with 2 poisons it can deplete roughly 20% of his health.\nWhen he has lost 50% of his life bar, he enters phase 2 and adds lightning attacks to his kit. The lightning on his weapon adds AoE distance to his ground slam, so either roll inside the circle or keep a good distance to avoid the larger AoE. He casts a lightning bolt which is telegraphed by raising the shield hand. As soon as the shield drops, roll to avoid the bolt. When he calls a lightning storm, stay back until it clears as he will do a swiping attack with his shield at the same time.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nDraconic Tree Sentinel is much heavier than the known Tree Sentinel, with stronger attacks that have added area of effect and more options to strike you at range. Their mount shoots fireballs constantly whenever you are at a long distance from them. And it's very recommended to use your mount moving in circles around them while throwing projectiles. Bring lots of ammunition and bring heavy ammunition if you can. It can be simple to throw attacks all the time, but it's still very tedious as this enemy wears heavy armor.\nOne the Knight enters to phase 2, it may be recommended to always keep distance and switch between being mounted and unmounted, unmounted to dodge and defend and mounted to attack while moving. Mind the area you are moving, as there are trees around that may block you by surprise and some of the Knight attacks are very unforgiving, as some are even able to one-shot some players. Spirit Ashes are very helpful, but don't use them as distraction, instead you distract the Knight while the spirits attack them, keep them focused on you. Don't expect much as spirits will be eventually defeat as the Knight's attacks affect large area of effect.\nFaith casters: Upgrade your sacred seal to +14 for S tier incant scaling. 2 stacks of scarlet rot and chip damage from lightning spear is all that's necessary to defeat the sentinel. Most of his attacks are easily dodged from a distance, just be wary of his leaping slam which has a large AoE sphere. Before the fight, use a physick with Cerulean Hidden Tear and Opaline Bubbletear to make Rotten Breathe free to cast and prevent damage from the first hit. Stand far enough away so that just the edge of the blast hits him. Although lightning spear won't deal heavy damage, it's okay because one rotten breath removes 30% of his HP. If you have trouble applying the second stack of scarlet rot, save your spirit summon until after the first stack of scarlet rot wears out. Once he aggros the summon you have time to cast it. \n Poison Mist Cheese Method\nThis method uses Poison Mist incantation, Finger Seal, and Cerulean Flasks to replenish FP. To cast Poison Mist safely you will need to sneak behind the Sentinel. There are 2 ways, you can summon a spirit ash to distract him, move to the fog gate, quit to main menu and reload. Or you can simply hug the wall on his right side, sneaking while crouched down and you can circle around him. Either way once you're behind him safely, repeatedly cast Poison Mist. It requires 2-3 casts to poison him. The AI doesn't recognize this as an attack since it deals no direct damage, and the sentinel won't move/attack. Once the poison eventually wears off, cast to apply again until he dies. This process takes 10-15 minutes as the poison takes time to tick down.\nTo gain Faith, use Commoner's Garb (+1), Ruler's Mask (+1), Two Fingers Heirloom (+5),  or a Rune Arc with Godrick's great rune (+5).\n\nDraconic Tree Sentinel Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nHammer Attack\nHits the ground violently with his massive hammer.\nRoll towards his shield side if possible, otherwise back up.\n\nQuick Hammer Strike\nPerceivably NO windup frames, from idle he instantly brings his hammer down.\nStand/ fight on his shield side.\n\nLunging Strike\nThe boss lunges with his horse and slams his hammer down. If your not close to him he'll run up to you first. After the boss does some ranged attacks he reengages you with this.\nRoll away from him to avoid combo. With good positioning you can roll directly to your right, aiming to pass his horse's head to get to his shield side.\n\nSentinel’s Slam\nHorse rears back as the boss holds his hammer menacingly over his head for a long time. Then brings it down to a massive AOE which will catch you if you are near midrange. The boss tracks the player the entire wind up.\nRoll or more easily full retreat, farther than you think. Safe area to roll is behind him after he commits and stops tracking you.\n\nHorse Stomp\nHorse rears back and attempts to stomp on you. His horse will track you and pivot until a moment/ animation commit, then will lung forward stomping down.\nIf melee strafe behind him, otherwise back up.\n\n Horse Stomp(Hammer) \nHorse rears back like Horse Stomp combined with the hammer raised high. It will bring the hammer down with a quick follow-up.\nIf melee strafe to shield side, otherwise back up.\n\nFireball\nThe Sentinel’s steed shoots a fireball. Mainly used to punish healing from afar.\nRoll, either to the sides or forward. Can be parried with Golden Retaliation or Carian Retaliation.\n\nRearingFireball (Close-range)\nThe steed rears up and shoots a fireball below it.\nRoll towards shield side, forward for melee.\n\nShield - Backwards Swipe\nBrings his shield in front of him then swipes backwards. Has longer reach than other shield attacks.\nRoll, forward for melee.\n\nShield -Forward Swipe\nBrings his shield behind him then swipes forward.\nRoll, forward for melee.\n\nShield -Forward Swipe(Repositions)\nAppears the same as Forward Swipe, but the wind up is perceivably slower. After attacking the boss leaps away and repositions.\nRoll.\n\nShield -Smash\nBrings shield down in a straight line.\nRoll, forward for melee.\n\nShield -Double Smash\nBrings shield down quickly twice. First attack appears identical to the single Smash\nRoll and roll, both forward for melee. If caught can still roll away from second strike.\n\nShield -Delayed Smash\nHolds shield above his head then slams it down.\nCan either strafe to his back staying on shield side or roll, forward for melee.\n\nPhase 2\n\nLightning Strike\nRaises shield imbued with lightning and swipes his shield sideways. This summons a random field of incoming lightning strikes with hurtboxes larger than they appear.\nSafe: Full retreatRisky: If you can see the incoming lightning on the ground you can avoid it. Quickly backpedal to find a safe area to stand in whenever he imbues calls lightning, then move to the safe area.\n\nHoned Bolt\nHe raises his shield imbued with lightning and brings it straight down. This sends a targeted lightning strike down on you. Will trigger if outside his melee range.\n Two options:1) Watch his shield. As he brings it down the lightning will strike in time with that motion. DO NOT roll forward, seems player animation gets caught by lightning.2) Standing under his shield bugs out the targeting, no roll necessary. \n\nThunderous Smite\nRaises his hammer, now with imbued lightning except the AOE is *even bigger* and sends out seemingly random lightning rippling out, effectively tripling the attack radius.\nThe only safe roll area is inside the area where his mace strikes or behind him after he commits and stops tracking you. The lightning ripples will hit you anywhere else.\n\nLightning Wave\nThe sentinel places his hammer on the ground behind him with horse crouched low then rips his weapon forward, shooting out a massive wave of lightning. Has extremely long range. The tracking on this is insane and this move will end a run since he *combos* it with a follow up Thunderous Smite and possibly another Lightning Wave.\nPositioning is critical. If you are close you can run towards his horses head and roll into his mace before he attacks. Otherwise you have to roll through the wave.\n\nDraconic Tree Sentinel Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nFirst shown in the Elden Ring Gameplay Preview, fighting off both the player and their summon.\nIt is rumored that during the development of the game he was called Kuseng, Draconic Tree Sentinel\n\n Draconic Tree Sentinel  Capital Outskirts  \n\nDrops\n50,000Dragon GreatclawDragonclaw Shield\n\nHP\n8,398\n\nElden Ring Draconic Tree Sentinel Boss (Capital Outskirts)\n\nThis is an optional boss, but either it or Fia's Champions must be defeated to enter Leyndell, Royal Capital\nClosest Site of Grace: Auriza Hero's Grave\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: \n\nMillicent: Give her the Valkyrie's Prosthesis and defeat the Godskin Apostle in Windmill Village\nGreat Horned Tragoth: On the path just downhill from the Statue of Marika.

QUESTION
How can Scarlet Rot be effectively used in the Draconic Tree Sentinel boss fight in Elden Ring?

ANSWER
Scarlet Rot can be effectively used in the Draconic Tree Sentinel boss fight by inflicting it before the boss spots the player, summoning Tragoth for decent damage and aggro, and using Rotten Breath Spell for an easy kill.
