These signs will have three NPC Duelist Adversaries, each with an equipment loadout copied from a random player, all named "Knight of the Great Jar". Each adversary will drop a Furlcalling Finger Remedy and a variable amount of Runes. Upon defeating all three of these adversaries without dying, talking to the Great-Jar again will have him shake a bit, as if he is laughing, and reward you with the Great-Jar's Arsenal Talisman.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: The Great-Jar\nIntroduction\n\n...\n\nUpon completing the Great-Jar's Trial\n\n...\n\nTalking again after completing the trial\n\n...\n\nElden Ring Great-Jar Notes & Trivia\nFAQ: How do you kill Elden Ring's Great Jar? \n\nThe Great Jar does not have an official HP bar on display and has very few interactions other than the trial you can participate in with him. But even his trial does not directly involve the Great-Jar in battle. If you attempt to attack him, nothing happens and dialogue with him does not change. There is no HP bar that displays if any damage had been taken. However, as NPC in the game he still shares similar features from regular NPCs. Players have found a way to damage the Great Jar cause him to fall. This displays the same animation as other fallen jars. If this action is attempted, nothing will happen and players will gain nothing. \n\nGreat-Jar Other Notes\n\nWhen participating in the Great-Jar Trial, the duelists do not scale with the Tarnished's level and weapon upgrades. Duelists utilize end-game gear and spells, and have thousands of health points. Most players will find themselves getting one-shotted if attempting this at low level.\nIf having difficulty with the trial there are a couple of tactics that can make it more manageable. \n\nIf playing online the pool of opponents will be randomized builds of other online players, but if beginning your game in offline mode the the enemies will always be the same: One mage build with a long thrusting sword and casting staff, a dexterity build using a fast sword (poison skill) and buckler, & a strength build using a mace (holy skill) and tower shield.\nIf you run past the giants using torrent when you approach the summon signs, between summon battles you can use the giants to replenish flasks as each one will refill a portion of your total flasks when killed.\nIf you don't care to fight them much at all then a very quick method of dispatching the Duelists is to, once you've summoned one, immediately run south and slightly west, making a beeline for the Minor Erdtree across the way until you reach the fog barrier that appears. There is a section of rock where the barrier meets the cliffs; this is where you want to fight. Once the duelist has spawned, they should run down to your position to attack. With your back to the fog gate, bait an attack and dodge to the right towards the road/path; this should leave the duelist at the edge of cliff with their back facing the water. Rush in a couple quick hits or otherwise apply some form of knockback to have them fall to their deaths. Repeat for the others and this challenge can be finished in less than 3 minutes and any RL with good dodge/parry timing. \n\nThe randomized builds of the Knights of the Great Jar come from other players who have successfully obtained Great-Jar's Arsenal while playing online.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Boc the Seamster  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
