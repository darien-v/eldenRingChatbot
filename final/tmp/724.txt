Once you reach the area, you'll encounter a Golem guarding the elevator, you can skip past the golem and enter the elevator, the door will automatically open once you go near it. Step on the mechanism to activate the elevator, it will bring you down the Ainsel River.\nOnce you reach the bottom of the well, touch the site of grace. Head down, you'll see a group of Giant Ants clinging to a wall, ignore them for now and turn right, you'll see an item on the ground, pick it up and you'll get a Golden Rune [3]. Head straight from your position and at the edge of the waterfall, there's a corpse, pillage the remains to get Magic Grease x3.\nHead back to the cave where you saw the Ants clinging to the wall. Bait them one by one to target you to pick them off or aggro them and use an AoE spell/incantation or AoW to quickly finish them off. Flame of the Redmanes AoW can kill them in one hit. Enter the cave and pillage the corpse and you'll get Grace Mimic x8. Be careful, there is one ant waiting to the right just behind the wall ready to ambush you. As you move forward another ant will come up, kill the ant and turn left, there are two more ants there and once you get past them, there's a Smithing Stone [3] x1.\nNow go back to the main path, there will be two more ants that will drop down from above.

On the left side you'll see an ant guarding a corpse holding an item, kill the ant and pillage the corpse, you'll obtain a Smithing Stone [3].\nNow jump up and continue following the path. You'll come across a Queen Ant, killing her will reward you with a Rune Arc x1 and a Golden Rune [10] x1. Then 7 more ants will spawn in the area and attack you relentlessly. Eliminate the ants and backtrack to where you obtained the Silver Firefly earlier, you'll notice there's another path, turn left and continue following that path until you see the end of the tunnel. Immediately you'll spot a Ghost Glovewort [1] by the pillar, and just behind it is a corpse holding a Shattershard Arrow (Fletched) x10. On the left corner there's another corpse holding a Smithing Stone [3].\nOnce you've gathered the items, head up the stairs and go straight to activate the site of grace in the area. Then turn back and enter the room just beside the site of grace, step on the mechanism to activate the elevator and bring you down, once you reach the bottom you will have reached the Uhl Palace Ruins.\nUhl Palace Ruins\nOnce you reach the area, jump down the right side and hug the wall on your right and move forward, you'll see a corpse holding a Golden Rune [1].

Hug the wall on your left to obtain a Smithing Stone [1]. More Claymen will be seen in the area, using a high level AoE spell/incantation will do the trick and one-shot these opponents. On the right side you'll spot another corpse holding a Golden Rune [2]. Just behind the wall is another Ghost Glovewort [1]. From here, you'll see two items above you but to get them, you will need to backtrack to where you encountered the Queen Ant earlier and follow that path. Once you reach the edge, jump down, you'll see a corpse, pillage the remains to obtain a Smithing Stone [4]. then jump down the platform below, another corpse lays there holding a Celestial Dew.

The items you will obtain from the corpses on the stairs are a Furcalling Finger Remedy, Throwing Dagger x6, Magic Grease x2, and a Golden Rune [3]. Ignore the Claymen at your left for now and turn right, a group of Claymen will also be present, you can try to run past them or you can use a one-hit AoE spell/incantation or AoW to get past them. Go up the stairs and pillage the corpse there to obtain another Golden Rune [3]. There will be three Claymen by the stairs, you can just run past them. Be wary of the Malformed Star as it will keep shooting you once it sees you out of a cover.
