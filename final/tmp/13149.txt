The Wretch is the “deprived” of the game. It starts at level 1 with 10 on all stats and just a club for weapons. It is the weakest starting Class in Elden Ring, and should be selected by those who want an added challenge in the earlier parts of the game. The Classes only determine the starting Stats and Equipment of the player, but as the game progresses, players can freely change their build to their preferred playstyle.\n\nAs poor, purposeless and naked as the day they were born.

Significantly easier than going through the game with an entirely different starting class just to try a new build.\nSince start of the game does not have any non-optional boss, starting with this class is easier than in previous games.\nYou can get your first armor set by farming Godrick soldiers near Groveside cave entrance.\nNotes, Tips, and Trivia go here\n\nElden Ring Classes\n\nAstrologer  ♦  Bandit  ♦  Confessor  ♦  Hero  ♦  Prisoner  ♦  Prophet  ♦  Samurai  ♦  Vagabond  ♦  Warrior\n\n
