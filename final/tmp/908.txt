It wields a large greatsword and is found at the end of Castle Morne. This individual has stolen the treasured sword of Castle Morne, the one Edgar promised to protect. He is summonable for this fight if his and Irina's questline have been progressed to a certain point.\nThis is an optional boss as players are not required to defeat it to advance. The Leonine Misbegotten is extremely aggressive and it may be difficult to find openings to attack it. You will find yourself rolling most of the time in order to create distance as a ranged character, or as an alternative to Guarding as blocking it's attacks will deplete your Stamina quickly. It drops the Grafted Blade Greatsword when defeated.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. Great Enemy bosses can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items.\nLesser Misbegotten Warrior is the normal enemy form of this boss. Other variants of this boss appear in the Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior, Perfumer Tricia and Misbegotten Warrior, and Misbegotten Crusader boss fights.\n\nElden Ring Leonine Misbegotten Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss.\nClosest Site of Grace: Beside the Rampart Gaol\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\nNPC Summons: Edgar - Begin the Irina questline and deliver Irina's Letter to Edgar to unlock his summon sign\n\nElden Ring Leonine Misbegotten Location\nLeonine Misbegotten can be found in the southwestern shores of Castle Morne at the Weeping Peninsula. From the Beside the Rampart Gaol Site of Grace, head southwest across a wooden bridge towards a tower. The boss's arena is clearly visible from this tower. Find a ladder at the side of the tower to get to the shores below. There are several non-hostile Spirit Jellyfish here that you can stroll past. Continue south to find the boss's mist gate.

For example, if a negation is 60, 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% will be negated. Bigger number = less damage. A negation of 100 means no damage goes through, and a negation of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances\n\nPoison: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nScarlet Rot: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nHemorrhage: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nFrostbite: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\n\nSleep: 316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\nMadness: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers are the buildup amount to trigger it. For example, if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of the given buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs. The values after the "/"s indicate the increased resistances after each successive proc.\n\n NG+ and Beyond (click to reveal)\n\nNG\nNG+\nNG+2\nNG+3\nNG+4\nNG+5\nNG+6\nNG+7\n\nHP\n2,199\n5,179\n5,696\n5,955\n6,214\n6,732\n6,991\n7,250\n\nDefense\n103\n117\n120\n123\n129\n135\n141\n152\n\nRunes\n3,800\n19,000\n20,900\n21,375\n22,800\n23,275\n23,750\n24,225\n\n Resistances \n\nPoison\n316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\n344 / 442 / 732 / 1189\n349 / 447 / 737 / 1194\n354 / 452 / 742 / 1199\n359 / 457 / 747 / 1204\n364 / 462 / 752 / 1209\n369 / 467 / 757 / 1214\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n\nScarlet Rot\n316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\n344 / 442 / 732 / 1189\n349 / 447 / 737 / 1194\n354 / 452 / 742 / 1199\n359 / 457 / 747 / 1204\n364 / 462 / 752 / 1209\n369 / 467 / 757 / 1214\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n\nHemorrhage\n316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\n344 / 442 / 732 / 1189\n349 / 447 / 737 / 1194\n354 / 452 / 742 / 1199\n359 / 457 / 747 / 1204\n364 / 462 / 752 / 1209\n369 / 467 / 757 / 1214\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n\nFrostbite\n316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\n344 / 442 / 732 / 1189\n349 / 447 / 737 / 1194\n354 / 452 / 742 / 1199\n359 / 457 / 747 / 1204\n364 / 462 / 752 / 1209\n369 / 467 / 757 / 1214\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n\nSleep\n316 / 414 / 704 / 1161\n344 / 442 / 732 / 1189\n349 / 447 / 737 / 1194\n354 / 452 / 742 / 1199\n359 / 457 / 747 / 1204\n364 / 462 / 752 / 1209\n369 / 467 / 757 / 1214\n374 / 472 / 762 / 1219\n\nMadness\nImmune\n\nElden Ring Leonine Misbegotten Boss Guide\n\nLeonine Misbegotten Boss Video Guide\n\nLeonine Misbegotten Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for Leonine Misbegotten:\n\nSummon Edgar if you are having trouble with the Misbegotten's aggressive attacks. \nUse the Lone Wolves to direct attention away from you. They could easily stunlock him, but are rather frail otherwise. Demi-Humans can also work wonders.\n\nMelee Users\nThis boss attacks quickly and can deal a lot of damage if it hits. Guarding is difficult: you'll take a considerable amount of Stamina damage unless you use Ash of War: Barricade Shield. It's better to dodge most of its attacks if you can, punishing its leap attacks and overhead vertical attacks that leave it briefly vulnerable.\nBarricade Bounce: If you do use Barricade Shield, all the Misbegotten's attacks (other than Hopping Slam) will bounce right off your shield. This will give you plenty of chances to guard counter and eventually break its stance.\nStaggeringly Effective: Leonine Misbegotten is particularly easy to interrupt—it will break out of an attack animation when hit with a jumping or charged heavy attack from almost any weapon. Use this to your advantage to interrupt combos when attacks have long windups, and you can quickly and safely build up both HP and Stance damage.\nMagic and Ranged Users\nDodge its attacks and use spells like Carian Slicer or Glintstone Pebble to whittle its health down during its Hopping Slam, Hopping Stab, and Vertical Slash. Bow users should use a Shortbow and punish the same attacks, jump-shooting and shooting when they land.\n\nLeonine Misbegotten Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nLunging Slash\nGets down on all fours, raises its haunches, then jumps towards you and slashes its sword. Used when you're further away\nRoll when it pauses briefly in the air and then again to avoid the potential Hop Slice. Only parriable at close range\n\nRunning Slash\nPulls its sword behind its shoulder as it runs towards you, then lets loose a wide slash. Used when you're further away\nRoll when you see the hilt of the sword pass its head\n\nSideswipe\nRuns past you on all fours and slashes you in passing\nRoll and prepare to roll again once the follow-up is in the air\n\nBarbaric Roar\nRaises its arms in front of its head, then lets loose a fearsome roar dealing damage in a small area of effect\nDodge or walk away when you see its arms go up\n\nHop Slice\nHops a little bit and slams the sword down vertically in front of it\nRoll to the left or right\n\nDouble Swipe\nSwipes back and forth with its left paw\nRoll backwards twice, since it will close some distance during the attack\n\nStamp Sweep\nStomps its foot, then spins its sword in two full circles\nOnce you see it raise its foot, you'll have enough time to run out of range without dodging. Come back and hit it during its long recovery\n\nSlash\nSwings its sword once clockwise\nRoll backwards twice to get out of range of the whole combo, and attack when it's finished\n\nDouble Slash\nSwings its sword once counterclockwise and then once clockwise\nRoll backwards once and attack when it's finished\n\nSlice & Leap\nSwings its sword counterclockwise, then leaps high into the air and stabs its sword into the ground\nRoll backwards to avoid the first slashes, roll again while it's hanging in midair, then get in some damage while it recovers. Only the initial slice is parryable\n\nSlice & Slam\nSwings its sword clockwise, holds it over its head momentarily, then slams it down in front\nRoll forward and to the right to end up behind it and avoid the slam. Only the slam is parryable\n\nHopping Slam\nJumps into the air and grabs the blade of its sword, slamming it into the ground and creating a small shockwave. May be repeated once\nRoll when you see its sword cross its face\n\nVertical Opener\nSwings its sword over its head and down in front of it, beginning a combo\nRoll backwards twice to get out of range of the whole combo, and attack once it's finished\n\nHorizontal Opener\nSwings its sword clockwise, beginning a combo\nThis attack is particularly tricky because it can combo into so many different moves. Either parry it to prevent that or roll away a couple times and wait for the combo to end\n\nLeonine Misbegotten Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nKnown as Leonine Aberration in 1.00 version of the game\nUses the “Old Warriors” boss theme\nOther Notes and Trivia Go Here\n\nLeonine Misbegotten Combo Chart\n\nLeonine Misbegotten Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
