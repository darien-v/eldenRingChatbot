Once you’ve opened a map to a new place, you can find new tunnels by looking for a small black semi-circles surrounded by a faint orange outline on the map. It isn't possible to get a +24 weapon without clearing some dungeons (namely Leyndell), but you can get at least up to a +15 right at the beginning of the game just through exploration and avoiding enemies.\nStarting from Limgrave, head up north to Stormhill and go to the cliffside southeast of the Warmaster’s Shack where a bunch of Trolls are hanging out. Make one destroy the stone statue in the area to get 5 Smithing Stone (1) and a Smithing Stone (2). Next head south to the Limgrave Tunnels to find 8 more Smithing Stone (1). In tunnels, Smithing Stones can be found on the walls or floors where enemy miners are currently mining, as yellow crystals on the ground, or on corpses lying around.\nExit the tunnel and follow the road going up north to Stormhill. When you get to the end of the collapsed bridge, jump down to the cliffside on the left and follow the path up to Liurnia of the Lakes. Head northwest to find 3 Smithing Stone (2) in a gazebo southwest of the Temple Quarter. In the southwestern part of the Academy Gate Town, you’ll find another 3 Smithing Stone (2) on a corpse near a Giant Crab. Head southeast to find a gazebo with 3 Smithing Stone (3) in it and slightly further north is a corpse on a chair with another 3 Smithing Stone (3). Make your way up north to the Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel to collect the rest of your Smithing Stone (2) and (3). You can find 5 Smithing Stone (2) and 8 Smithing Stone (3) there. You can also obtain the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (1) by defeating the boss here to buy unlimited Smithing Stone (1) and (2) at the Twin Maiden Husk if you wish.\nHead up north to the Ruin-Strewn Precipice to find 9 Smithing Stone (4) and 2 Smithing Stone (5). Teleport back to Limgrave and take the teleporter chest at the Dragon-Burnt Ruins to get to the Sellia Crystal Tunnel. There, you will find 8 Smithing Stone (5). Head west and enter the Gael Tunnel to find 8 more Smithing Stone (4). You’ll have to interact with the Site of Grace near the end to leave. You can find the last 2 Smithing Stone (5) at Redmane Castle.\nUpgrading your weapon past +15 will require you to progress in the game. Finding higher level Smithing Stones in tunnels is harder and you may have to rely on the unlimited stock you get from finding their respective Bell Bearing. You can obtain the two halves of the medallion for the Grand Lift of Dectus without fighting to take you to Altus Plateau. The Sealed Tunnel houses 3 Smithing Stone (6) and the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (2) for an unlimited stock of Smithing Stone (3) & (4). You'll find the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (3) at Zamor Ruins in the Mountaintops of the Giants for unlimited Smithing Stone (5) & (6). The Yelough Anix Tunnel in Consecrated Snowfield has 8 Smithing Stone (8) and you can obtain the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (4) for unlimited Smithing Stone (7) & (8) by defeating the Godskin Duo at Crumbling Farum Azula.\nThe earliest Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone you can acquire is from helping Jerren at the end of Sellen's questline. You'll have to progress far enough to defeat Rennala at the Academy of Raya Lucaria and Radahn during the festival at Redmane Castle to be able to finish this quest and obtain the stone.\n\nEarly Max Level Unique Weapon in Elden Ring\nIt is possible to get a +9 unique weapon at the start of the game without defeating any bosses; it just requires some exploration and running away from enemies. From the First Step Grace, follow the road north to the Gatefront Ruins then head east. Cross the bridge to get to a cliff overlooking the northeastern part of Lake Agheel. Sitting on a chair on this cliff is a corpse with a Somber Smithing Stone (1) on it. Head back on the road and follow it south into the Weeping Peninsula. After crossing the Bridge of Sacrifice, keep following the road south to approach Castle Morne. After grabbing the map for the area, split off the path to the left (towards the southeast) and head down onto the beach. The red jellyfish here are guarding a corpse in the water with a Somber Smithing Stone (2).\nTeleport back to the Gatefront Ruins and follow the road northwest. At the end of the collapsed bridge, jump down to the cliffside on the left and follow the path up to Liurnia of the Lakes. Grab the Lake-Facing Cliffs grace and make your way north towards the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Grab the Academy Glintstone Key from behind Smarag and enter the academy. Make a beeline for the Church of the Cuckoo Grace just in case you get defeated. Behind the altar in the previous room is a Somber Smithing Stone (3).\nRun through the dungeon, past the graveyard, and onto the large waterwheel-like lift. Get grabbed and killed by the Abductor Virgin at the bottom to be taken to Volcano Manor. Instead of following the path here to the Subterranean Inquisition Chamber, you’ll want to jump down onto the lava below. To the left of the lava waterfall, is a large pile of rocks, and to the left of these rocks is a slight protrusion in the floor. If you jump to the left of the protrusion and surf the wall just right, you won’t take and fall damage and can run through the lava to a safe platform with a Burning Slug. Head southwest towards the ruined buildings and climb up the slope you see to your left to get to an area with many cages and cage lifts. Scale the roofs to the southwest to find a corpse with a Somber Smithing Stone (6).\nJump down onto the lava level and go back up the slope to the cage area. Head up the northeastern cage lift and to the right is a Somber Smithing Stone (5). Head up the stairs, making sure to avoid getting hit by the enemy here. Activate the bridge shortcut in the northwest to be able to reach the next smithing stone. You'll find a corpse on the balcony at the far end of the bridge. You can jump up there by jumping from the small iron piece on the side of the bridge to the chain wheel. From the chain wheel, you can then jump up onto the balcony to grab the Somber Smithing Stone (7). Interact with any Site of Grace in the area to be able to leave afterwards. You can be defeated to get back up to the ledge that leads to the Subterranean Inqusition Chamber Site of Grace.\nTeleport back to Gatefront Ruins and make your way south to the Dragon-Burnt Ruins in Lake Agheel. Interact with the chest to get teleported to the Sellia Crystal Tunnel. In the tunnel, you’ll find multiple Somber Smithing Stone (4)s. In the main chamber, head up the slope until you are able to jump on the roof of the central storage shed. Jump onto the wooden platform in the east and hop over the barricade blocking the tunnel. Go through the tunnel until you end up in a room with a ladder and wooden walkways above. A stone is found on a body on one of the walkways.\nExit the tunnel and make your way towards the Divine Tower of Caelid in Dragonbarrow. On a small dead branch just before you get to the tower, you’ll find a Teardrop Scarab that drops a Somber Smithing Stone (8) (careful it explodes). Follow the cliff here southeast and when you get to the lower cliff ledge, head north on this lower ledge to find a group of corpses sitting on chairs, one of which has a Somber Smithing Stone (9).\nThe quickest way to get an Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone is by doing Varre's quest. You will have to kill at least one shardbearer to progress his quest, but with up to 9 Somber Smithing Stones, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem. Finish Varre’s quest to receive the Pureblood Knight's Medal (you can get maiden blood from the dead maiden in the Church of Inhibition). Using it takes you to the Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Grace. Progress through the mausoleum, running and doing your best to dodge enemies attacks until you reach the next Site of Grace, Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint. From the grace, you should be able to see a large statue surrounded by many Albinaurics and a Sanguine Noble. In front of that statue is a chest with a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone in it. It may take a death or two to open it if you’re low level at this point.\n\nSpirit Ash Upgrades\nSpirit Ash Upgrades universally increase the summons' Attack Power and Defenses.\nGiant Rat Ashes are unique in that enhancing the spirit ashes will increase their numbers.\n\nWhere to Upgrade Spirit Ashes\nRoderika is the only NPC capable of upgrading Spirit Ashes. She offers her services after a short side-quest:\n\nTalk to Roderika at the Stormhill Shack [Map Link]\nHead to Stormveil Castle and collect Chrysalids' Memento [Map Link]\nReturn to Roderika and return the memento\nTravel to the Roundtable Hold and exhaust both her and Blacksmith Hewg's dialogue\nReload the area by leaving or other means\nRoderika will now be sat across from Blacksmith Hewg and is able to upgrade your Spirit Ashes\n\nStandard Spirit Ashes\nCan be upgraded to +10 using Grave Gloveworts.\n\nRenowned Spirt Ashes\nCan be upgraded to +10 using Ghost Gloveworts.\n\nTotal Upgrade Costs - Spirit Ashes\n\nStandard Spirit Ashes upgrades require 1 Grave Glovewort per level.\n\nBell Bearing\n Standard\nUpgrade Material\nUnit Cost\nTotal Cost\n\nGlovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [1]\nTo +1\nGrave Glovewort [1]\n800\n800\n\nTo +2\nGrave Glovewort [2]\n1,200\n2,000\n\nTo +3\nGrave Glovewort [3]\n1,600\n3,600\n\nGlovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [2]\nTo +4\nGrave Glovewort [4]\n2,400\n6,000\n\nTo +5\nGrave Glovewort [5]\n3,200\n9,200\n\nTo +6\nGrave Glovewort [6]\n4,000\n13,200\n\nGlovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [3]\nTo +7\nGrave Glovewort [7]\n5,000\n18,200\n\nTo +8\nGrave Glovewort [8]\n6,000\n24,200\n\nTo +9\nGrave Glovewort [9]\n8,000\n32,200\n\n-\nTo +10\nGreat Grave Glovewort\n-\n32,200\n\nRenowned Spirit Ashes upgrades require 1 Ghost Glovewort per level.\n\nBell Bearing\n Renowned\nUpgrade Material\nUnit Cost\nTotal Cost\n\nGhost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [1]\nTo +1\nGhost Glovewort [1]\n1,200\n1,200\n\nTo +2\nGhost Glovewort [2]\n1,800\n3,000\n\nTo +3\nGhost Glovewort [3]\n2,400\n5,400\n\nGhost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [2]\nTo +4\nGhost Glovewort [4]\n3,600\n9,000\n\nTo +5\nGhost Glovewort [5]\n4,800\n13,800\n\nTo +6\nGhost Glovewort [6]\n6,000\n19,800\n\nGhost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [3]\nTo +7\nGhost Glovewort [7]\n7,500\n27,300\n\nTo +8\nGhost Glovewort [8]\n9,000\n36,300\n\nTo +9\nGhost Glovewort [9]\n12,000\n48,300\n\n-\nTo +10\nGreat Ghost Glovewort\n14,000\n48,300\n\nEarly Max Level Standard Spirit Ash in Elden Ring\nSteps 1-4, up to a +7 Standard Spirit Ash, can be done without fighting any Bosses\nMinimum 6 Bosses* for +10 Standard Spirit Ash\n\nGrave Glovewort [1] and Grave Glovewort [2] are found at the Impaler's Catacombs, Limgrave [Map Link]\nGrave Glovewort [3], Grave Glovewort [4], and Grave Glovewort [5] are found at the Minor Erdtree Catacombs, Caelid [Map Link] or Caelid Catacombs, Caelid [Map Link]\nReach the Altus Plateau using the Dectus Medallion Halves\nGrave Glovewort [6], Grave Glovewort [7] are found at the Gelmir Hero's Grave.
