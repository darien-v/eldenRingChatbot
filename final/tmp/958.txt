Gelmir. It was worshipped long ago by the ancient people of Mt. Gelmir, who offered up sacrifices to the powerful serpent god using a specific curved sword. The Serpent-Hunter was once used to hunt down the immoral god and it's true power manifests when faced against it.\nThis is an optional boss, as players don't need to defeat it in order to advance in Elden Ring.  God-Devouring Serpent is the First Phase of Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. Unlike most boss phases, the God-Devouring Serpent has its own health bar which must be depleted before you can challenge the Second Phase. Note that dying to his Second Phase as Rykard will require you to defeat the serpent once again. Right as you enter the arena to the God-Devouring Serpent, you'll immediately be able to find and equip the Serpent-Hunter - a Great Spear with special properties in this boss fight. Rykard, and the God-Devouring Serpent by extension, drops Rykard's Great Rune and the Remembrance of the Blasphemous when defeated.\nBosses are unique and challenging Enemies that can be encountered all over the Lands Between. They can drop unique Spirit Ashes, Weapons, Spells, and other various Items.\n\nThe great serpent of Mt. Gelmir that swallowed Praetor Rykard. Attacks with poisonous spit, bites, and slams. \n\nElden Ring God-Devouring Serpent Boss\nGod-Devouring Serpent is a Demi God Boss found in Mt. Gelmir. [Map Link]\n\nThis boss is optional, as only two shardbearers must be defeated to gain access to Leyndell, or only Starscourge Radahn if the player uses the secret entrance in Deeproot Depths.\nThis is a Demi God-class boss.\nClosest Site of Grace: Audience Pathway\nMultiplayer: Yes (summoned players can't enter boss fight, if fight has not begun)\nSpirit ashes: Yes\n\nElden Ring God-Devouring Serpent Location\nSee Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy for location information.\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Combat Information\n\nHealth: NG (30439), NG+ (38475), NG++ (42323), NG+3 (44247), NG+4 (46170), NG+5 (50018), NG+6 (51942), NG+7 (53866)\nDeals Fire Damage and Standard Damage. May also inflict Poison.\nParriable: No\nCan be poise broken, but can't be riposted afterwards.\nWeak to Serpent-Hunter and Frostbite\n\n Upon defeat, a cutscene will play and the fight against Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy will begin.\n\nAbsorptions:\n\nStandard: 10\nSlash: 10\nStrike: 35\nPierce: 10\nMagic: 40\nFire: 80\nLightning: 20\nHoly: 40\n\nThe absorption numbers are the % of your damage that gets blocked. For example if an absorption is 60. 40% of that damage by that type will go through and 60% is absorbed. Bigger number= less damage. An absorption of 100 means no damage goes through, and a resistance of -100 mean the enemy takes 2x damage from that source. 0 means damage goes pretty much as is.\n\nResistances:\n\nPoison: 252\nScarlet Rot: 252\nHemorrhage: 252\nFrostbite: 112\nDeath: Immune\n\nThe resistance numbers is the buildup amount to trigger it. For example if a resistance is 100 you must deal 100 points of whatever aux buildup to trigger it. Note that these go down over time, and increase each time the effect procs.\n\nElden Ring God-Devouring Serpent Boss Guide\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Boss Video Guide\n[video coming soon]\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Fight Strategy\nThe Best Tips for God-Devouring Serpent:\n\nUse the Serpent-Hunter Great Spear found at the beginning of the boss' chamber. \n\nCheck your equipment load (to avoid fat-rolling) after equipping the spear; it's heavy!\n\nUse the Mimic Tear Spirit Summon while equipped with the Serpent-Hunter to significantly reduce the boss' difficulty.\n\nGeneral Strategy\nBe sure to pick up the Serpent-Hunter Great Spear held by a corpse at the beginning of the boss' chamber. It has a special interaction with this boss fight in which it manifests a blade of light with every attack, significantly increasing its range and allowing players to damage both phases of the boss from outside of the magma pool he stands in.\nThe Serpent's attacks primarily consist of lunging strikes and bites. It can also perform a special grab animation with its jaws in which it slams you down twice. However, this move only deals damage once. The Serpent will sometimes raises its head up high and then slam its chin on the ground, sending magma flying outward in a very wide arc. This attack can be dodged through or blocked to reduce damage.\nIf you opted to use the Serpent-Hunter, you should constantly be poking him between his attacks. Enough hits on the head will cause the Serpent to go down briefly, allowing you a much needed window of uninterrupted attacks.\nOnce the Serpent is defeated, Phase Two begins with Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. See Rykard's page for relevant information.\nCheese Strategy\nThe God-Devouring Serpent and by extension, Rykard can be made significantly more easy by summoning the Mimic Tear Spirit while equipped with the Serpent-Hunter. The Mimic copies your current equipment and this extends to the blade of light functionality of the Serpent-Hunter. The Mimic will attack of its own volition and you will still need to dodge the boss' attacks properly but having what is essentially a second player firing blades of light at him will massively cut down the amount of time and effort required to defeat the boss.\nMelee Users\nStrategy Writeup for Melee Users\nIf player wants to beat the boss without Serpent-Hunter as a melee, he should focus on inflicting Status-Effects (Frostbite and Blood loss).\nMagic and Ranged Users\nStrategy Writeup for Magic Users\nIf the player wants to beat God-Devouring Serpent without Serpent-Hunter, the optimal spells would be Borealis's Mist & Ekzykes's Decay (Incantation) or Rock Sling (Sorcery). Beginning of fight gives a good opportunity to apply Status Effect. \n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\nSnake Bite\nThe Serpent lunges from one side towards you. It will sometimes follow up with a second lunge from the opposite direction.\nDodge towards the direction the lunge is coming from.\n\nGrab Attack\nThe Serpent raises its head up high and lunges forward. If the attack connects, the snake will grab the player, slamming them twice but dealing damage only once.\nRequires precise timing to prevent the grab.\n\nPoison Spit\nThe Serpent spits several globs of poison that spread out in various directions, leaving a pool of poison on the ground momentarily.\nStay within medium range to prevent it from using this move. Do not stand in poison puddles.\n\nMagma Slam\nThe Serpent raises its head up high, tilting it to the back. It then slams its chin on the ground, sending magma flying outwards in a very wide arc in front of it.\nDodge through the magma or block it to reduce damage.\n\nMagma Upheaval\nThe Serpent raises and coils its head on its left and then plunges its face into the ground. After a short delay, it pulls its head from the ground, causing a wide magma eruption that travels forward in front of it.\nThis move is very difficult to dodge but can be blocked with a shield to significantly reduce damage.\n\nMagma Thrash\nThe Serpent raises its head up high, looking to the side with its jaws wide open. It then begins thrashing about the magma as it spins around 360 degrees, sweeping with its head and tail, sending magma splashing about in random directions.\nMaintain your distance and avoid any flying magma.\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nGod-Devouring Serpent Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Lichdragon Fortissax  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n
