\n\n Rogier's Letter \n\nType\nInfo Item\n\nEffect \n\n        Letter written in a trembling hand \n\nRogier's Letter is an Info Item in Elden Ring. Tutorial items provide information about how to add Skills to your Weapons, Crafting advices, Combat tips, and more. They can be obtained through exploration and looting, dropped by specific Enemies or Bosses, or purchased from NPCs\n\nLetter written in a trembling hand.\n"I forgot to tell you, but it seems D has a younger brother.\nI heard he lies in a deep sleep in the aqueduct beside the Eternal City of Nokron.\nAnd it's said he stood before the Prince of Death not far beyond that spot."\n\nWhere to find Rogier's Letter in Elden Ring\nObtained from Rogier's corpse in Roundtable Hold after he passes away.\n\nElden Ring Rogier's Letter Tutorial Guide\nDo Sorcerer Rogier's questline up until stage 9 on his page, which states-\n"Ranni will now allow the player to become one of her vassals and begin her questline. Returning to Rogier results in him warning the player that he is worried he will fall into a deep slumber - he is on the brink. Resting at the site of grace will in fact show that now he has fallen into the slumber he spoke of."\nI confirmed resting or traveling immediately after he states such, that he will be unresponsive and have flies around him the next time you come back, he still is not dead after multiple trips immediately to and from the roundtable hold to test it but will also update when he does.\nUPDATE: About 12 real hours, 4 travels and no rests, I did the Converted Tower and Road's End Catacombs and discovered the Revenger's Shack Site of Grace, ported back to the Roundtable Hold for the 5th time to upgrade weapons and continue Ranni's quest to talk to Blaidd in Siofra region after doing Rogier's entire quest, and he has JUST NOW appeared dead. It seems it may just be time based for when he dies as those were the last 2 things I had not explored before going to Altus Peninsula. -Zeeningg\n\nElden Ring Rogier's Letter Notes & Tips\n\nNotes and player tips go here\n\nElden Ring Info Items\n\nAbout Adding Affinities  ♦  About Adding Skills  ♦  About Birdseye Telescopes  ♦  About Bows  ♦  About Combat With Spirit Ashes  ♦  About Containers  ♦  About Cooperative Multiplayer  ♦  About Crouching  ♦  About Death  ♦  About Dodging  ♦  About Duels  ♦  About Fast Travel to Sites of Grace  ♦  About Flask of Wondrous Physick  ♦  About Guard Counters  ♦  About Guarding  ♦  About Guidance of Grace  ♦  About Horseback Riding  ♦  About Hunter Multiplayer  ♦  About Invasion Multiplayer  ♦  About Item Crafting  ♦  About Marika's Effigy at the Roundtable  ♦  About Materials  ♦  About Monument Icon  ♦  About Multiplayer  ♦  About Pouches  ♦  About Requesting Help from Hunters  ♦  About Roundtable Hold  ♦  About Sites of Grace  ♦  About Skills  ♦  About Sorceries and Incantations  ♦  About Spiritspring Jumping  ♦  About Stakes of Marika  ♦  About Stance-Breaking  ♦  About Strengthening Armaments  ♦  About Summoning Other Players  ♦  About Summoning Pools  ♦  About Summoning Spirits  ♦  About Teardrop Scarabs  ♦  About the Cave Of Knowledge  ♦  About the Map  ♦  About United Combat and Combat Ordeals  ♦  About Vanquishing Enemy Groups  ♦  About Wielding Armaments  ♦  Carrier Pigeon Letter (1)  ♦  Carrier Pigeon Letter (2)  ♦  Champion's Song Painting  ♦  Flightless Bird Painting  ♦  Homing Instinct Painting  ♦  Knifeprint Clue  ♦  Letter from Volcano Manor  ♦  Letter to Bernahl  ♦  Letter to Patches  ♦  Meeting Place Map  ♦  Note: Below the Capital  ♦  Note: Demi-human Mobs  ♦  Note: Flame Chariots  ♦  Note: Frenzied Flame Village  ♦  Note: Gateway  ♦  Note: Gravity's Advantage  ♦  Note: Great Coffins  ♦  Note: Hidden Cave  ♦  Note: Imp Shades  ♦  Note: Land Squirts  ♦  Note: Miquella's Needle  ♦  Note: Revenants  ♦  Note: Stonedigger Trolls  ♦  Note: The Lord of Frenzied Flame  ♦  Note: The Preceptor's Secret  ♦  Note: Unseen Assassins  ♦  Note: Walking Mausoleum  ♦  Note: Waypoint Ruins  ♦  Prophecy Painting  ♦  Red Letter  ♦  Sellia's Secret  ♦  Sorcerer Painting  ♦  Weathered Map  ♦  Zorayas' Letter\n\n
