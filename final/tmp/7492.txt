The Clawmark Seal is a Weapon for characters that wish to use beast Incantations without investing in faith.\nClawmark Seal can be used to cast certain spells that need to be memorized first. This Seal is much less visible than the staff, so someone could perform a surprise magic attack while fighting against enemy players. Sacred invocations must be memorized first at a site of lost grace, and a sacred seal must be equipped to cast them.\n\nA sacred seal given by Gurranq, the BeastClergyman. A rare trinket which allows incantations to be scaled with strength. \nThe claw mark represents Gurranq's wrath. Enhances bestial incantations learned from Gurranq.\n\nWhere to Find Clawmark Seal in Elden Ring\nThe Clawmark Seal weapon can be found at the following location:\n\nGiven by Gurranq Beast Clergyman after feeding him a Deathroot. Elden Ring Map Link\n\nElden Ring Clawmark Seal Notes & Tips\n\nSkill: None\nThis weapon cannot be buffed with Ashes of War.\nClawmark Seal is upgraded with Smithing Stones.\nBuffs the damage of all Bestial Incantations by 10%, stacking multiplicatively with Cinquedea. \n\nNote that if you are trying to purely maximize damage of Bestial Incantations, you will see better results by using the Erdtree Seal at high faith levels, in conjunction with either Cinquedea or an offhand Clawmark seal, since the spellbuff of the Erdtree Seal is so much higher that it more than makes up for the additional 10% bonus.\nClawmark seal really shines when used on high-Str characters who want a ranged/fast attack option, but don't want to invest heavily in another stat.\n\nIncantations cast with this seal also scale with strength; two-handing this seal will further increase incant scaling due to the 50% effective strength bonus. This extra scaling is not shown in the inventory.\nAt +10, with 45 Faith and 45 Strength the incant scaling softcaps at 280. Increasing either Faith or Strength up to 99 gives a poor 30 scaling per stat for a 340 Incant Scaling hardcap. Due to strength receiving a 50% bonus two-handing the softcap can be attained at just 30 strength and 45 faith by two-handing this seal.\nOnly Faith applies to offensive buff Incantation scaling, making this Seal a bad choice for those using such spells (Bloodflame Blade, Electrify Armament, Black Flame Blade, etc)\nThe same applies to healing spells.\nBestial incantations include Stone of Gurranq, Gurranq's Beast Claw, Beast Claw, and Bestial Sling.\nViable spellcasting for a Strength Build with barely any investment into int, fth, arc. Great for evening the playing field against actual spellcasters. Pocket sand will never let you down. (Can also use other low requirement non-bestial incants like catch flame to decent effect)\nIt is wielded, but not dropped, by Azula Beastman Mages, to cast red lightning Incantations.\nSell Value: 100\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.08 a bug that prevented the follow-up attack from occurring when the Black Sword Incantation was activated with a Sacred Seal in the left hand has been fixed.\nNOTE: As of Patch 1.09, the scaling values of this weapon were changed.

QUESTION
Why does the Clawmark Seal shine when used on high-Strength characters who want a ranged/fast attack option without investing heavily in another stat?

ANSWER
The Clawmark Seal shines on high-Strength characters for ranged/fast attacks due to scaling benefits with strength, enhancing bestial incantations without requiring heavy investment in other stats.
