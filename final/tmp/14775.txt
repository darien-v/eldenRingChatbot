CONTEXT
\n\n Boc the Seamster \n\nLocation\nLimgrave\n\nRole\nGarments Adjuster andQuest NPC\n\nVoiced by\nCalvin A. Dean\n\nBoc the Seamster is an NPC in Elden Ring. Boc is a Demi-Human who is capable of advanced communication. Boc is initially met by the player in the form of a small tree.\nOnce you have completed Boc's questline, he appears at Graces in the Altus Plateau, and allows you to Alter equipment without paying the standard 500 rune fee. Boc does not provide any new or different alterations. \n\nBoc the Seamster, at your service. Ready to make adjustments to your garments.\n\nBoc the Seamster Location in Elden Ring\nBoc the Seamster can be found in multiple locations:\n\nBoc the Seamster is first encountered east of the telescope that is south of Agheel Lake North Site of Grace in Limgrave. He is disguised as a small tree and will call out to you upon approaching. [Map Link]\nAfter meeting him the first time, Boc will move to the Coastal Cave in western Limgrave. You will find him on the ground right next to the Site of Grace. [Map Link]\n\nAfter giving Boc the Seamster the Sewing Needle at this second location, he will be able to appear at the following remaining four locations, depending on furthest Site of Grace that the player has rested at. Resting at any of the Site of Graces listed below, will make him appear there, in ascending order.  \n\nAt all the following locations, he will now offer his service of altering garments.\nAt all the following locations except Lake-Facing Cliffs, Boc can be given the Gold Sewing Needle, if you're carrying alterable boss armor (e.g. Radahn's Lion Armor).\n\nHe can be found kneeling by the Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace, north of Stormveil Castle in Liurnia of the Lakes.  You have to rest at the Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace for him to appear. [Map Link]\nHe can be found kneeling by the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace (southwest most point of the Bellum Road). You have to rest at the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace for him to appear. Map Link\nHe can be found kneeling by the Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace in Altus Plateau. You have to rest at the Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace for him to appear. [Map Link]\nHe can be found kneeling by the East Capital Rampart Site of Grace in Leyndell Royal Capital. You have to rest at the East Capital Rampart Site of Grace for him to appear. Map Link\nThe questline now branches in one of three ways. You can either: \n\nGive him a Larval Tear, and upon resting, he will move next to Rennala. He will not respond when talked to. If you rest again, the questline will end.\nPerform the "You're Beautiful" Prattling Pate in front of him, then discuss it. \nDo neither of the options above. This will move him right outside of Raya Lucaria Grand Library, ending the questline.\n\nAfter choosing the "You're Beautiful" branch, telling him he's beautiful when he asks and making progress in Leyndell, Boc relocates to the East Capital Rampart Site of Grace.\n\nBoc the Seamster Questline: How to complete Boc the Seamster's Quest\nFirst Encounter\nUpon first encounter,  northwest of the Murkwater Bridge, Boc is disguised as a tree and calling for help. If you perform an attack on the tree, the spell breaks and Boc returns to its original form. He will then narrate how he was expelled from his cave and had everything he owned taken, humbly rewarding you with x10 Mushrooms, which is everything he currently has. However, he states that if you wait, he could sneak back into the cave and retrieve some of his belongings, which could make him useful to you.\n\nSecond Encounter\nThe second encounter with Boc is at Coastal Cave, within a few steps into the entrance tunnel, right besides the Coastal Cave Site of Grace. [Map Link] He is lying on the floor as he's been beaten up when trying to recover his belongings. In order to help him you must venture inside the cave. But beware, however, as there are many Demi-Humans ahead, and these creatures tend to attack in groups.At one point in Coastal Cave you'll reach the Demi-Humans' settlement, where you will encounter even more enemies and two Demi-Human Chief bosses. Upon defeat, these Bosses will drop Boc's belongings:\n\nx1 Tailoring Tools\nx1 Sewing Needle\n\nGo back to Boc The Seamster at Coastal Cave's entrance and deliver the tools to him. He will thank you and after you move, he'll no longer be at that location.\nNOTE: It is also fine to defeat the Demi-Human Chiefs first and then encounter Boc by the Murkwater Bridge afterwards. Exhaust his dialogue and then return to the cave to give him the sewing materials.\n\nThird Encounter\nYou can later find Boc The Seamster at the Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace in Liurnia of the Lakes. He is glad to see you and offers to make adjustments to your garments. \n\nFrom now on, he will be able to alter the garments of the player.\nSome armor pieces can be changed to an alternative design. This service is free of charge. This will lower the stats of the affected armor piece, but for the most part is cosmetic as the stat drop is generally very minor. (This function basically removes the cape from armor pieces.)\n\nHis quest can be continued if these three conditions are met:\n\nRetrieve the Gold Sewing Needle from the Church of Vows on the east side of Liurnia of the Lakes.\nBuy at least one piece of legendary boss armor that can be altered from Finger Reader Enia at the Roundtable Hold. Note that only demigod armor counts as "legendary", so armor such as Briar Armor won't work despite being alterable and sold by Enia. \nYou have spoken to Melina about Boc at the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace.\n\nThis enables the option to give him the Gold Sewing Needle, which makes it possible to alter legendary armor as well. If you do not have the option to give him the gold sewing needle then, either:\n\nYou do not have the Gold Sewing Needle in your inventory\nYou do not have legendary armor that can be altered in your inventory. Remember, like all the other (non-boss) armor found in the game, not all of it can be altered. Same rule applies to Boc and the gold needle. In addition, only armor worn by demigods is considered legendary.\n\nNOTE: You can skip seeing him here and still find him at later at different locations, depending on progress.\n\nFourth Encounter\nBoc will leave the Lake-Facing Site of Grace after Accessing Raya Lucaria Academy and move to the East Raya Lucaria Gate Site of Grace. After speaking with him here and resting at the Site of Grace, you will then have the option to speak with Melina, who will remark on Boc.\nNOTE: You can skip seeing him here and still find him at later at different locations, depending on progress.\n\nFifth Encounter\nHe can be found at Altus Plateau at the Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace.\nNOTE: You can skip seeing him here and still find him at later at different locations, depending on progress.\n\nSixth Encounter\nHe can be found at Altus Plateau next to the East Capital Ramparts Site of Grace.\nIf not done at this point, this is the last location Boc the Seamster will appear and stay at, until giving him the Gold Sewing Needle.\nIf he now (or at any other possible location before) received the Gold Sewing Needle, his quest will continue and he will remark about his ugly appeareance and asks your opinion on it. He will imply his desire to be rebirthed by Rennala.\nYou have different choices how to proceed:\n\nYou can give him a Larval Tear, and upon resting, he will move next to Rennala. He will be reborn into a human form, and he will not respond when talked to. If you rest again, he will die.\nAlternatively, you can perform the "You're Beautiful" Prattling Pate in front of him (found in Hermit Village at Mt.Gelmir), then discuss it.\nUsing the Prattling Pate in front of him removes the option to give him a Larval Tear. Choose either to give him a Larval Tear OR use the Prattling Pate.\n\nDialogue in Elden Ring: Boc The Seamster\nIntroduction\n\n"Oi! You there! Could you help us out, cully?You, yeah, you there! Stop pretending you can't see me".\n"Why won't anyone look me in the eye?I'm not that ugly".\n\nIf attacking the tree in which Boc was turned into\n\n"Ow! What'd you go and do that for!Hm? Oh, yes, I remember. Some clod turned me into a tree.You were just breaking the spell, weren't you.Thank you. The name's Boc.I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever.Then I ended up as a tree.Lucky you came along, really.Boc the seamster, at your service, Master".\n"Oh, what a shame.When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned, and so this is all I have to express my thanks.I hope you can forgive me".[Hands over x10 Mushroom]\n"Or, if you can afford to wait for a while, I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value.Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon".\n"Right, but I'll need a moment.I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself.My knees start knockin'...just thinking bout that god-awful cave on the shore".\n\nAt Coastal Cave\n\n"Oh... It...hurts..."\n"Oh, what are you doing here?You must leave this place at once. They'll rush in and beat you to a pulp.You'll end up just like me".\n\nVisit\n\n"Boc the Seamster, at your service. Ready to make adjustments to your garments".\n\nGiving the Sewing Needle\n\n"Wait, is that what I think it is? You got it back for me? My sewing needle!What made you go and do a thing like that....My mum was a seamstress...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by. I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum.  Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I?"\n\nAfter receiving the Sewing Needle\n\n"Thank you. You're very kind".\n\nAt Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace\n\n"Good to see you! Master. Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human. You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle.Please, master. Allow me to serve you, as your seamster. I can't make nothing from scratch, but...I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments".\n\n[Don't tell me...]\n\n"Master, I was wondering... Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself? I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please. I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well... I am your personal seamster, after all!".\n\nDid you see it? At East Capital Rampart\n\n"Master, did  you see it? Th-the Erdtree? I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...But I was so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast. The Erdtree is waiting for you, Master. I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones". \n\nLeaving\n\n"Oh, going so soon? Please, do be safe on your journey".\n\nI'm sorry...\n\n"Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods, and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them.My mum told me once. That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy.Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too!"\n\nAfter receiving the Gold Sewing Needle\n\n"Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it... Oh!Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life! With a spectacular royal crest, to boot...Are you certain that this is for me? Oh, I can hardly believe it.Have faith in me, Master! I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift!I'll be the golden seamster, Boc! Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods!"\n\nI have a favor to ask\n\n"Would you mind if I called you lord? I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord.Well, I know that you will be the one, and you'd make just the manner of kind hearted lord that I'd wish for.So, please, if you would. Allow me to call you lord."\n(If you say yes): "M'lord, m'lord, m'lord! Please become Elden Lord.And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side."[You receive the "My Lord" Gesture]\n\nSurely she'd be happy for you?\n\n"That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now. Oh, it's still not enough.I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her."\n\nHave you ever thought so?\n\n"Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria has the power to help people be reborn.Oh? Me? Reborn? Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly... well being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid."\n\nWhat do you really think?\n\n"In all honesty, what do you think of me? Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness?Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me?Oh, I'm such a fool. I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions"\n\nAfter receiving a Larval Tear\n\n"Oh! Oh! It can't be... For my rebirth? But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me? Oh... M'lord how did you know? It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance."\n\nPlease wait\n\n"I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria. I'll be reborn, fresh and new."\n\nAfter hearing the Prattling Pate "You're Beautiful"\n\n"Thank you very much. Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice. Please, if I may dream, just once...Do you feel the same way my mum did m'lord? Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?"\n(If you say yes): "M'lord, my dear lord...I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service. May the throne of Elden Lord be yours."\n(If you say no): "No, why on earth would you? It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did. But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance. One day, I'll look every bit the servant."\n\n[The voice was mine.]\n\n"Master... kind Master... I, Boc the Seamster, am forever in your service."\n\nWhen attacked\n\n(Before starting his quest) "Mum... I've... I've let you down"\n(Warning) "Ow! M-m'lord? Is something wrong? It's me! Boc, the seamster!"\n(Combat) "Oh, my... M'lord, is that the truth, your heart of hearts? My, oh my... Ah... aaah!"\n(On player kill) "M'lord... What have I done?"\n\nUpon defeat\n\n"M'lord... I've failed you... please, forgive me."\n\nElden Ring Notes & Trivia for Boc\n\nVoiced by Actor Calvin A. Dean\nBoc was featured in the Elden Ring Network Test at the same location.\nBoc wears the Aristocrat Hat and uses the Great Knife during combat.\nBoc can be killed with one hit. Once killed, Boc will not respawn, even after using Celestial Dew.\nDespite Boc's questline involving you turning over the Sewing Needle and Tailoring Tools, you are still able to perform alterations at any Site of Grace, as the Tailoring Tools will stay in your inventory. Boc will offer the same services, simply as an alternative. \n\nThe advantage of alterations done by Boc over a Site of Grace is that Boc will not charge you for altering clothing. Using the Tailoring Tools at a site of grace will cost Runes each time an alteration is made.\n\nOnce you obtain a demi-god armor set, you can ask Boc why he does not offer altering demi-god's garments with the "I'm sorry..." option. He will then provide input as to why he doesn't alter those garments due to what his mother used to tell him, and that maybe he may become good enough to do so someday.\nThanks to the latest Patch, he is easier to find in Limgrave, now that his voice triggers from a farther distance from before. An Arteria Leaf was also placed near him to lure players to hear him.\n\nWhat Garments can you Alter in Elden Ring?\nSpecific Helmets and Body Armor pieces in Elden Ring can be altered when have the required Items for altering. You will need a Sewing Needle and Tailoring Tools to be able to perform alterations to your basic garments. The Gold Sewing Needle is required in order to be able to alter demigod armor pieces.\nBoth Sewing Needle and Tailoring Tools items can be obtained from the Demi-Human Chief, located in Coastal Cave, western Limgrave. Map Link. This is a boss encounter. Defeat the Demi-Human Chief and it will drop these items. With these tools you can now rest at any Site of Grace to access your options and you should have the option to Alter Garments. This should display your Armor pieces before and after Alterations. Select which garment to alter. Altering will also cost runes, so make sure you are happy with the alterations before confirming. Altering your garments with Boc, however, will be free, but you will need to progress through his questline before this action is available. \nTo gain access to Boc's altering services, go through his questline until he moves to the Lake Facing Cliffs Site of Grace. You will first need to locate him northwest of the Murkwater Bridge, Boc is disguised as a tree and calling for help. If you perform an attack on the tree, the spell breaks and Boc returns to its original form. You will then need to give him the Sewing Needle and Tailoring Tools. He will be at the  Coastal Cave. After giving him his supplies he will then move to Liurnia of the Lakes where the Lake-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace is. He will now offer his seamster services to you for free.\n\nElden Ring NPCs\n\nAbandoned Merchant Siofra River  ♦  Aeonian Spirit  ♦  Aeonian Swamp Spirit  ♦  Albinauric Village Spirit  ♦  Albus  ♦  Ashen Spirit  ♦  Blackguard Big Boggart  ♦  Blaidd  ♦  Bloody Finger Hunter Yura  ♦  Brother Corhyn  ♦  Carian Manor Spirit  ♦  D's Twin Brother  ♦  D, Hunter of the Dead  ♦  Deathtouched Spirit  ♦  Diallos  ♦  Dung Eater  ♦  Eclipse Spirit  ♦  Edgar  ♦  Enia  ♦  Ensha  ♦  Erdtree Sanctuary Spirit  ♦  Fia  ♦  Finger Maiden Therolina  ♦  Frenzied Spirit  ♦  Frustrated Spirit  ♦  Gate Town Bridge Spirit  ♦  Gatekeeper Gostoc  ♦  Gideon Ofnir  ♦  Godwyn the Golden  ♦  Goldmask  ♦  Gowry  ♦  Grape Spirit  ♦  Gurranq Beast Clergyman  ♦  Hermit Merchant  ♦  Hyetta  ♦  Imprisoned Merchant  ♦  Irina  ♦  Iron Fist Alexander  ♦  Isolated Merchant Raya Lucaria  ♦  Isolated Merchants  ♦  Jar Bairn  ♦  Kenneth Haight  ♦  Kingsrealm Spirit  ♦  Knight Bernahl  ♦  Laiedd Spirit  ♦  Latenna  ♦  Lionel the Lionhearted  ♦  Liurnian Highway Spirit  ♦  Liurnian Lake Spirit  ♦  Lost Snow Spirit  ♦  Master Lusat  ♦  Melina  ♦  Merchant Kale  ♦  Millicent  ♦  Millicent's Sisters  ♦  Miquella  ♦  Miriel Pastor of Vows  ♦  Morne Spirit  ♦  Nepheli Loux  ♦  Nomadic Merchant Mohgwyn Palace  ♦  Nomadic Merchant West Altus Plateau  ♦  Nomadic Merchants  ♦  Patches  ♦  Pidia, Carian Servant  ♦  Preceptor Seluvis  ♦  Primeval Sorcerer Azur  ♦  Queen Marika  ♦  Ranni the Witch  ♦  Renna  ♦  Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon (NPC)  ♦  Roderika  ♦  Rya  ♦  Rykard  ♦  Sanguine Noble (NPC)  ♦  Shabriri  ♦  Shaded Castle Spirit  ♦  Siofra River Spirit  ♦  Smithing Master Hewg  ♦  Sorcerer Rogier  ♦  Sorceress Sellen  ♦  Stranded Graveyard Spirit  ♦  Study Hall Spirit  ♦  Tanith  ♦  The Great-Jar  ♦  The Two Fingers  ♦  Thops  ♦  Three Fingers  ♦  Tower of Return Spirit  ♦  Twin Maiden Husks  ♦  Two Fingers  ♦  Volcano Manor Spirit  ♦  Wandering Artist Spirit  ♦  War Counselor Iji  ♦  White Mask Varre  ♦  Windmill Spirit  ♦  Witch-Hunter Jerren\n\n
