There is a Two Finger for every demi-god in the game, except Morgott and Mohg, who share a Two Finger. After killing Morgott and inspecting the thorns, you discover that you must burn the Erdtree to enter. The Two Fingers will then point straight up in an attempt to contact the outer gods.  One you kill a demi-god and receive a Great Rune, it will be shown as powerless. To activate it's power you must activate it at the demi-god's Two Fingers. This implies that the true power of the Great Rune is within the Two Fingers.
