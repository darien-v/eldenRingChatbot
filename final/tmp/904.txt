This massive four-winged black dragon wields powerful lightning attacks and is found in Deeproot Depths. During the War of the Ancient Dragons, where the forces of Leyndell battled against the ancient dragons, Godwyn befriended Fortissax. After his death, Fortissax struggled to stave off the death blight that afflicted Godwyn, and was later corrupted by it. This is an optional boss, and doesn't need to be defeated in order to advance in Elden Ring. However, it must be defeated to achieve a certain ending.\nThis boss is missable if the player kills Fia before the end of her quest.\nAncient Dragon Lansseax is another variant of this boss. Farum Azula Dragon is the normal enemy form of this boss.\n\n After Godwyn the Golden became the Prince of Death, the ancient dragon fought long and hard against the Death within its companion. Alas, victory was never achieved and its only reward was corruption.\n\nElden Ring Lichdragon Fortissax Boss\n\nThis is an optional boss, but it must be defeated to achieve a certain ending\nClosest Site of Grace: Prince of Death's Throne\nMultiplayer is allowed for this boss\nYou can summon  Spirit Ashes  for this boss\n\nElden Ring Lichdragon Fortissax Location\nFrom the Prince of Death's Throne Site of Grace (which can only be accessed by defeating Fia's Champions), give Fia the Cursemark of Death, talk to her three times, and reload the area.

Greatshield Soldiers can be a decent alternative, though they do not deal as much damage.\nUse spells and incantations that summon large numbers of projectiles or hit multiple times, such as Rock Sling, Meteorite of Astel, Rotten Breath, and Comet Azur. \nBring Lightningproof Dried Livers, Boiled Crab, and Rejuvenating Boluses.\nEquip the Prince of Death's Cyst or Pustule or reduce Death Blight buildup. \nLike all Ancient Dragons, you can only lock onto their head and body, so it is recommended to unlock and attack their legs instead.\n\nMelee Users\n\nThis guide covers preparation for the fight and general strategy. For how to counter each individual attack, see the table to the right.\nFortissax is most consistently and most safely fought by standing in front of his head and punishing his various attacks. While it is possible to defeat him by running under him and hacking at his ankles, a strategy highly effective against his sister, Fortissax's lightning barrier renders this style of play significantly more risky. Not only does it make the fight slower by forcing you to dodge or sprint constantly to avoid being struck by the dropped charges, but it can combine unfavorably with other attacks to either stun you into them or force an early roll that gets you hit by the incoming attack. Add to this that his head takes double damage, and it generally becomes the superior target for most of the fight, especially for non-status based builds.\nPreparation for this fight starts with the items. Boiled Crab, Lightningproof Liver, or (Golden) Lightning Barrier are highly valuable buffs that you should bring if they are available to you. The use of a Fireproof Dried Liver or other anti-fire defensive buff is inadvisable; these buffs cannot stack with one another and of the three damage types Fortissax inflicts, fire is both the easiest to dodge and the least commonly used. It is unlikely to be necessary, but if you are also struggling with being deathblighted, consider equipping the Prince of Death's Pustule to give yourself more leniency in that regard; an upgraded version is dropped by a runebear in the same area of the Deeproot Depths you fight Fortissax in. In terms of weapon selection, if you have a weapon capable of thrust attacks well upgraded and which you are comfortable using, consider selecting it. Not only is Fortissax highly vulnerable to thrust damage, but both his rearing firebreath and double bite attacks can be punished while he is doing them, which will allow you to take advantage of the counter state to deal significantly more damage. If you are able, consider also swapping to a highly lightning resistant armor set and potentially equipping one or more of the Pearldrake Talisman, Boltdrake Talisman, and Dragoncrest Shield/Greatshield Talisman to reduce the damage of Fortissax's attacks. Their boost to absorption, and not flat defense, makes them highly effective against the very high damage attacks Fortissax uses. Additionally, because Fortissax is highly resistant to both lightning and holy damage, you should use either physical damage weapons with fire, magic, or status resins (if buffable) or ones infused with magic or fire. Dexterity builds using lightning-infused weapons should change their affinity to Keen; faith builds might be better served by using unique weapons which scale non-holy damage from faith, such as the Erdsteel Dagger, Magma Wyrm's Scalesword, or the Magma Whip Candlestick. In any case, remember to consume the Baldachin's Blessing Fia gave you in the process of making this fight available, as it will reduce your maximum HP by 5% while in your inventory. Finally, select your Physic buffs of choice. Shrouding Cracked Tears of your weapon's damage type, the Spiked Cracked Tear, and Opaline Bubble and Hardtear are all good options for this encounter.\nOnce you have entered the arena by interacting with Fia, Fortissax will begin the battle by summoning Death Lightning. Buff up with your chosen items, then run up to Fortissax and begin attacking one of his forearms. While you do, turn the camera behind you and identify areas where few lightning bolts will strike. When this move ends, put your back to those areas as you begin to fight Fortissax in earnest. You will be moving backwards more or less continually as you dodge his attacks and stay in front of him, and thus avoiding moving through too many deathblight clouds will prevent an abrupt and embarrassing end to the fight. As you do, continue to attack Fortissax. His first phase will last until approximately 60% of his HP remains. In this phase, the primary punishable openings are his double bite, his death lightning summon, and his vertical slam. If you are confident in your spacing and roll timing, his rearing firebreath is also punishable and his lightning spear can be rolled through at the point of impact to guarantee several free hits as he recovers. To prompt him into performing these attacks, stand slightly in front of Fortissax's head. Because of how erratically Fortissax can move his head, and given the only other lock-on point is his body, it is advisable to avoid locking on for most of the fight. Instead, manually control the camera, and only lock on to better target Fortissax's head as you punish the double bite, dodge his forwards firebreath, or are keeping an eye on him as he flies. It is also advantageous to avoid standing far from Fortissax; this often prompts him to either summon death lightning or use his forwards firebreath. Neither attack is punishable at that distance and both can waste large amounts of time as you are forced to dodge the attack and close the distance.\nOnce you have brought Fortissax to 60% HP, his moveset will change in two ways. First, he will gain two new attacks: a version of his lightning spear where he summons two bolts and slams them sequentially into the ground, and a divebomb with a lightning glaive that ends in a double spin with the weapon extended. And secondly, his combos can now be extended. Initially, Fortissax's double bite had only a single possible followup (rearing firebreath), and his vertical slam had none. In phase 2, these attacks can both be followed by a right swipe, and the slam can also now be followed by a rearing firebreath or double bite. This is both good and bad; on the one hand, the slam is less punishable now, but on the other, the double bite is still mostly as punishable as before and is being used more often. The strategy remains the same; bear in mind the changed patterns and do not overcommit. Staying close to Fortissax is also more important in this phase; his most dangerous attack, the aerial glaive, is used more often if the player is at midrange or farther. Additionally, because Fortissax has more lightning-based attacks of greater potency, it may be worthwhile to increase your lightning defense at this point in the battle with a Lightningproof Dried Liver or (Golden) Lightning Fortification. Regardless, continue to punish the double bites and slams, in addition to any other attacks which happen to occur and which you feel comfortable responding to, until you achieve victory. Avoid becoming greedy towards the end; Fortissax's high damage and potential for an awkwardly timed stun from his lightning barrier make him particularly good at catching sloppy play out and setting you back to square one.\nIn summary: use items and equipment that increase lightning and/or physical absorptions, use thrust damage if possible and avoid using holy or lightning damage, stand in front of Fortissax and punish vertical slams and double bites, plan retreats through sparsely struck areas during Death Lightning summons, and be wary of moveset changes once Fortissax reaches 60% HP\nMagic and Ranged Users\nFor sorcerers, a basic spell like Rock Sling should be enough with a high enough catalyst. If not, keep away and watch for the Death Blight clouds around the arena. Keep Rejuvenating Boluses handy. Aim for his head for maximum damage.\n\nLichdragon Fortissax Attacks & Counters\n\nAttack\nDescription\nCounter\n\n Ancient Dragons’ Lightning Spear \n Fortissax rises to his hindlegs and raises his left arm. A massive fork-like bolt of red lightning appears in his grip, and after a brief delay Fortissax slams the lightning bolt forwards into the ground to create an electrical explosion. Lightning trails will radiate outwards from the point of impact, and both the initial blast and residual lightning will knock the player to the ground if it connects.\n  Sprint away from Fortissax, then sprint back in to jump attack his head, rolling through the residual lightning as you do.  Alternatively, the initial explosion can be rolled through at point-blank range for a longer punish if you feel confident in the timing. \n\n Fortissax's Lightning Spear (Phase 2 only) \nFortissax rises to his hindlegs and raises both arms. Two massive fork-like bolts of red lightning appear in his hands, and after a brief delay Fortissax slams the bolt in his left hand forwards into the ground to create an electrical explosion. After an extended delay, Fortissax then slams the bolt in his right hand into the ground to create a second electrical explosion. Both impacts release waves of lightning, and both will knock the player to the ground if they connect.\n  Sprint away from Fortissax, then sprint back in to jump attack his head as he slams the second bolt, rolling through the residual lightning as you do.  Alternatively, the initial explosions can both be rolled through at point-blank range for a longer punish if you feel confident in the timing. \n\n Fortissax's Lightning Glaive (Phase 2 only) \n Fortissax rises to his hindlegs and then leaps into the air, manifesting a massive glaive of red lightning in his left hand. He then dives towards the player, spinning two full circles to his left as he lands with the glaive outstretched. This attack will knock the player to the ground if it connects.\n Roll to the left very, very late. The timing on this attack is rather unforgiving; do not risk a dodge if you lack the HP to survive it. Instead, heal up and either dodge after or take and survive the hit if there isn't time.\n\nLightning Barrier\nFortissax is surrounded by a swirling barrier of red lightning. Players who stand within this barrier will continually become charged with red lightning. After a few seconds, this lightning will drop off the player to the ground. From there it explodes, doing minor damage and staggering the player if they remain too close to the blast.\nAvoid standing under Fortissax. If you become charged, walking is not fast enough to get away from the dropped bolt; run or roll as it falls off of you. Additionally, try to disengage from Fortissax by moving towards his tail; many of his forwards claw combos extend for greater periods and are more likely to be able to take advantage of a forced roll or hitstun from the charge than is his slow tail whip.\n\nDeath Lightning\nFortissax crouches down and then thrusts his head into the air. He will roar once initially, and then once more in a prolonged manner. As the second roar begins, numerous black-gold patches of electricity will appear on the battlefield. In a few moments, those patches will be struck by bolts of death lightning, which leave behind clouds of a deathblight-inflicting mist behind them for a fairly extended period.\n Move in and attack Fortissax's front legs, being mindful of the lightning barrier as you do. Once he stops, identify a path along which the mist is sparse, and put your back to that direction as you continue the fight.\n\n Claw Combo\n  Fortissax raises his left arm and slams it down in front of himself at an angle, such that his hand passes below her chin. He then pulls it back in a swipe from his right to his left. Both attacks cause small lightning explosions along the path of the attack a few moments after it completes. This combo will knock you to the ground if it connects with one of the physical attacks.  Follows: none Followed by: right swipe, rearing firebreath \n  Roll backwards and immediately roll again to dodge the first swipe and its lightning trail, then repeat the process for the second hit. Roll early through the attacks to have time to dodge the trail, and note that if you are hit by the first swipe's trail, the second swipe's trail cannot be avoided with a roll because you will be forced to roll late on the second swing, thereby preventing you from recovering fast enough to roll again. Additionally, avoid moving in front of Fortissax if you have been charged by his lightning barrier. This combo even without followups requires four near back to back dodges to dodge; being forced to roll early by lightning dropping off of you or being stunned by it into a hit can easily prove fatal. \n\nRight Swipe\n Fortissax raises his right arm and swipes it from his right to his left, causing a trail of lightning explosions in the path of the swing moments later. This attack will knock the player to the ground if the physical portion connects. Follows: claw combo, single bite, double bite (phase 2 only), vertical slam (phase 2 only) Followed by: vertical slam, rearing firebreath, repositioning hop, reverse right swipe (only if standing behind Fortissax and to his right) \nDodge backwards once to dodge the swipe and then immediately do so again to dodge the trail. Prepare for the potential followup.\n\nVertical Slam\n Fortissax rises to his hindlegs and raises his left arm above his head. After a brief delay, he falls forwards and slams his right hand into the ground, releasing a small electrical burst around the point of impact. This attack will knock the player to the ground if it connects. Follows: right swipe Followed by: right swipe (phase 2 only), rearing firebreath (phase 2 only), double bite (phase 2 only) \nMove backwards and roll once to the left. If performed correctly, you will roll to the right side of his head (left from your perspective) and be out of range of the electrical burst. Then, attack his head, remembering that this attack can be comboed into further moves in phase 2.\n\nDouble Bite\n Fortissax rises to his hindlegs, arches his neck to her right and opens his mouth, then bites forward. He then repeats the process with his neck arched to her left.  Follows: vertical slam (phase 2 only) Followed by: rearing firebreath, right swipe (phase 2 only) \nSprint out of range of the first bite, and charge a heavy attack as Fortissax bites a second time. As he finishes, release the heavy attack and hit his head. This is a safe punish in both phase 1 and phase 2 if performed properly.\n\nSingle Bite\n Fortissax arches his neck to her left, then bites forwards without coming off the ground. Follows: none Followed by: right swipe, rearing firebreath \nRoll backwards and right through the bite, and prepare for the followup. Additionally, be aware of the possibility of this move; even though Fortissax does not chain into it, it has fast startup and recovery that can lead to it being used surprisingly quickly after another attack or a non-chained followup being performed earlier than expected.\n\nRearing Firebreath\n Fortissax rises onto his hindlegs and arches his neck before spewing fire forwards. He then sweeps the fire under his body from his right to his left, and finishes the attack by spewing fire forwards again. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects. Follows: single bite, double bite, right swipe, claw combo, vertical slam (phase 2 only) Followed by: none \n If you are close to Fortissax when he begins this move, sprinting forwards will allow you to reach Fortissax's tail. Stand far back along it, and attack it as he breathes fire, using thrusting attacks if available to take advantage of the counter state. Note that you will become charged by his shield, so you will have to roll at least one dropped lightning bolt. Alternatively, if you have access to long ranged attacks, you can move backwards out of reach and attack. Otherwise, sprint backwards and to your left. As Fortissax finishes sweeping the fire from his right to his left and transitions into the forwards gout, sprint forwards towards his head and attack it once as it lands. The timing and positioning are very tight; you may simply wish to wait the attack out if you would rather play things safe. \n\nForwards Firebreath\nThis attack is often used when the player is far from Fortissax and in front of him. Fortissax arches his neck slightly, then exhales a long stream of fire forwards, sweeping slightly from his right to his left. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects.\nSprint diagonally forwards to your right. Note that unlike the similar looking attack from flying-dragon model enemies, this attack does not track the player\n\nAerial Firebreath\nhis is often used when the player is standing under Fortissax's chest. He crouches down, then launches backwards into flight as flame particles appear in his mouth. Fortissax then spits a gout of fire onto the ground at the player and flaps backwards to land.\nRun backwards out of range of the fire, then sprint forwards to close the gap once more.\n\nLightning Slam\nThis attack is often used when the player is standing under Fortissax. Fortissax rises to his hind legs and raises both arms. After a brief delay, he slams both claws into the ground under his chest, creating a large shockwave that will knock you to the ground if it connects. Waves of lightning propagate outwards from the point of impact as the shockwave dissipates,\nMove out from under Fortissax, then sprint back in after he slams, rolling through the waves of lightning as you do. Fortissax is vulnerable for a significant period following this attack.\n\nReverse Right Swipe\nThis attack is only used if the player is standing at Fortissax's right side after he has used a right swipe. Fortissax pulls his hand backwards from his left to his right in a swipe, leaving a trail of lightning which erupts moments later as he does. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects.\nAvoid standing at Fortissax's right side. If unavoidable, roll through the attack and then roll again to avoid the lightning, or sprint/roll forwards under Fortissax and out of reach.\n\nRepositioning Claw Swipe\nThis attack is commonly used when the player is standing at Fortissax's left side. Fortissax raises his left arm and swipes from his right to his left, turning to face the player in the process. This attack will knock the player to the ground if it connects, and leaves a trail of lightning that activates after a momentary delay.\nSprint backwards and out of range of the attack, or roll early through the claw swipe in order to have enough time to roll again immediately after and dodge the lightning.\n\nWing Beating\nThis attack is often used when the player is under Fortissax. Fortissax rises onto his hind legs and flaps his wings three times, staggering players caught under him. He then flaps a fourth time, knocking players to the ground if they do not dodge. This attack does not deal damage, only stuns.\nMove out from under Fortissax, and sprint in to attack once he flaps for a fourth time. Alternatively, dodge through each flap and attack after he completes the fourth.\n\nTail Swipe\nThis attack is often used when the player is behind Fortissax. The dragon raises his tail and bends it to his left, then swings himself counterclockwise around to face the player, sweeping the area behind and to the side of himself as he does. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects.\nDodge through the attack, or sprint out of range. \n\nDivebomb\n Fortissax launches himself backwards into the air, hangs there for a moment, and then dives towards the player. This attack will knock you to the ground if it connects. \nDodge forwards through the dive and attack the Fortissax's hind legs.\n\nRepositioning Hop\n Fortissax leaps forwards and glides a short distance, turning around as he lands. If he happens to land on a player, it will deal heavy damage and knock them to the ground. Follows: any attack which a rearing firebreath could Followed by: none \nTurn around and pursue Fortissax. If it looks like Fortissax might land on you, get out of the way.\n\nLichdragon Fortissax Lore, Notes & Other Trivia\n\nFortissax and Godwyn were said to be good friends, as Godwyn had bested him in battle, which explains why Fortissax guards his corpse.\nFortissax is riddled with thorns all over his body, which shows that he was afflicted by Death Blight, and was subsequently corrupted. \n\nLichdragon Fortissax Image Gallery\n\nElden Ring Bosses\n\nAbductor Virgins  ♦  Adan, Thief of Fire  ♦  Alabaster Lord  ♦  Alecto Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader  ♦  Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Ancient Dragon Lansseax  ♦  Ancient Hero of Zamor  ♦  Astel Naturalborn of the Void  ♦  Astel, Stars of Darkness  ♦  Battlemage Hugues  ♦  Beast Clergyman  ♦  Beastman of Farum Azula  ♦  Bell Bearing Hunter  ♦  Black Blade Kindred  ♦  Black Knife Assassin  ♦  Bloodhound Knight  ♦  Bloodhound Knight Darriwil  ♦  Borealis the Freezing Fog  ♦  Cemetery Shade  ♦  Cleanrot Knight  ♦  Commander Niall  ♦  Commander O'Neil  ♦  Crucible Knight  ♦  Crucible Knight and Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Crucible Knight Ordovis  ♦  Crucible Knight Siluria  ♦  Crystalians  ♦  Death Rite Bird  ♦  Deathbird  ♦  Decaying Ekzykes  ♦  Demi-Human Chief  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Gilika  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Maggie  ♦  Demi-Human Queen Margot  ♦  Draconic Tree Sentinel  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier  ♦  Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella  ♦  Dragonlord Placidusax  ♦  Elden Beast  ♦  Elemer of the Briar  ♦  Erdtree Avatar  ♦  Esgar, Priest of Blood  ♦  Fallingstar Beast  ♦  Fell Twins  ♦  Fia's champions  ♦  Fire Giant  ♦  Flying Dragon Agheel  ♦  Flying Dragon Greyll  ♦  Frenzied Duelist  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Adula  ♦  Glintstone Dragon Smarag  ♦  God-Devouring Serpent  ♦  Godefroy the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey the Grafted  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord  ♦  Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade)  ♦  Godrick the Grafted  ♦  Godskin Apostle  ♦  Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Apostle (Caelid)  ♦  Godskin Apostle and Godskin Noble  ♦  Godskin Duo  ♦  Godskin Noble  ♦  Grafted Scion  ♦  Great Wyrm Theodorix  ♦  Guardian Golem  ♦  Hoarah Loux, Warrior  ♦  Kindfred of Rot  ♦  Kindred of Rot  ♦  Leonine Misbegotten  ♦  Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree  ♦  Mad Pumpkin Head  ♦  Magma Wyrm  ♦  Magma Wyrm Makar  ♦  Malenia Blade of Miquella  ♦  Maliketh, the Black Blade  ♦  Margit, The Fell Omen  ♦  Messmer the Impaler  ♦  Mimic Tear  ♦  Miranda the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Misbegotten Crusader  ♦  Misbegotten Warrior  ♦  Mohg, Lord of Blood  ♦  Mohg, the Omen  ♦  Morgott the Omen King  ♦  Necromancer Garris  ♦  Night's Cavalry  ♦  Nox Swordstress & Nox Priest  ♦  Omenkiller  ♦  Omenkiller and Miranda, the Blighted Bloom  ♦  Onyx Lord  ♦  Perfumer Tricia  ♦  Putrid Crystalians  ♦  Putrid Grave Warden Duelist  ♦  Putrid Tree Spirit  ♦  Radagon of the Golden Order  ♦  Red Wolf of Radagon  ♦  Red Wolf of the Champion  ♦  Regal Ancestor Spirit  ♦  Roundtable Knight Vyke  ♦  Royal Knight Loretta  ♦  Royal Revenant  ♦  Runebear  ♦  Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy  ♦  Scaly Misbegotten  ♦  Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing (Boss)  ♦  Soldier of Godrick  ♦  Spirit-Caller Snail  ♦  Starscourge Radahn  ♦  Stonedigger Troll  ♦  Tibia Mariner  ♦  Tree Sentinel  ♦  Ulcerated Tree Spirit  ♦  Valiant Gargoyle  ♦  Wormface\n\n

QUESTION
Why is Lichdragon Fortissax described as an optional boss in Elden Ring, but must be defeated to achieve a certain ending?

ANSWER
It is described as optional but necessary for a certain ending in Elden Ring because defeating it is a requirement for achieving that specific ending.
